            <title>[CLJ-996] alter-var-root + protocol function call results in StackOverflow</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-996</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;The following code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;(ns example.core)

(defprotocol Foo
  (foo [x]))

(extend-protocol Foo
  &lt;span class="code-object"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt; (foo [x] x)
  nil (foo [x] nil))

(defn apply-foo [f]
  (fn [&amp;amp; args]
    (foo (apply f args))))

(alter-&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;-root #'assoc apply-foo)&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;takes forever to compile from emacs+swank. Running from &lt;tt&gt;lein repl&lt;/tt&gt; results in following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;user=&amp;gt; (use 'example.core)
StackOverflowError   clojure.lang.ArrayChunk.&amp;lt;init&amp;gt; (ArrayChunk.java:28)&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If delete the &lt;tt&gt;foo&lt;/tt&gt; call from the &lt;tt&gt;apply-foo&lt;/tt&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;(defn apply-foo [f]
  (fn [&amp;amp; args]
    (apply f args)))&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then code compiles and executes fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is true not only for &lt;tt&gt;assoc&lt;/tt&gt;, but also for &lt;tt&gt;conj&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;into&lt;/tt&gt; and possibly some other functions. Note also that crashes was seen even when the protocol function is not called, but there is call to &lt;tt&gt;satisfies?&lt;/tt&gt; in the &lt;tt&gt;apply-foo&lt;/tt&gt; function (although it's not clear for me how to reproduce it). Tested on clojure 1.3 and 1.4.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                        <description>&lt;p&gt;I think sorted-set (PersistentTreeSet) should implement the transient interface. It's a special-purpose set and should be usable just like every normal set.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Rich mentioned in IRC today he'd welcome a reducer implementation of clojure.core/range. Now that I've figured out how to do iterate, I figure I'll knock out range as well by the end of the night. Just opening the issue early to announce my intentions to anyone else interested in doing it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <comment id="28465" author="richhickey" created="Fri, 11 May 2012 13:21:42 -0700">&lt;p&gt;Yes, please merge these together, it's hard to see otherwise (I can barely read diffs as is &lt;img class="emoticon" src="http://dev.clojure.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/&gt;. range and iterate shouldn't be novel in reducers, but just enhanced return values of core fns. The enhancement (e.g. protocol extensions) &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; come by requiring reducers since it can't be leveraged without it. Also, I'm not sure how I feel about an allocating protocol for 'splittable' - I've avoided it thus far.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="28466" author="amalloy" created="Fri, 11 May 2012 13:30:02 -0700">&lt;p&gt;So you want clojure.core/range to return some object (a Range), which implements Counted and Seqable (but isn't just a lazy-seq), and then inside of clojure.core.reducers I extend CollReduce and CollFold to that type? Okay, I can do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't quite follow what you mean by an allocating protocol. I see your point that my fold-by-halves which takes a function in is analogous to a protocol with a single function, but it doesn't allocate anything more than foldvec already does - I just pulled that logic out so that the fork/join fiddly work doesn't need to be repeated in everything foldable. Do you have an alternative recommendation, or is it just something that makes you uneasy and you're still thinking about?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="28468" author="richhickey" created="Fri, 11 May 2012 13:52:39 -0700">&lt;p&gt;While vector-fold allocs subvecs, the halving-fn must return a new vector, for all implementations. It's ok, I don't think it's likely to dominate (since fj needs new closures anyway). Please proceed, but keep range and iterate in core. They are sources, not transformers, and only transformers (which must be different from their seq-based counterparts) must reside in reducers. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;When adding a patch, update the description of the ticket to indicate which file is the most recent. Leave old patch files around for historical reference.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="28472" author="amalloy" created="Fri, 11 May 2012 19:00:47 -0700">&lt;p&gt;It's looking harder than I expected to move iterate and range into core.clj. My plan was to just have them implement Seqable, which is easy enough, but currently they are actually instances of ISeq, because they inherit from LazySeq. A bunch of code all over the place (eg, to print them in the repl) depends on them being ISeq, so I can't just ignore it. To implement all of these methods (around thirty) would take a large amount of code, which can't easily be shared between Iteration, Range, and any future reducible sources that are added to core.clj.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could write a macro like (defseq Range &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;start end step&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; Counted (count &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;this&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; ...) ...) which takes normal deftype args and also adds in implementations for ISeq, Collection, and so forth in terms of (.seq this), which will be a LazySeq. However, this seems like a somewhat awkward approach that I would be a little embarrassed to clutter up core.clj with. If anyone has a better alternative I will be pleased to hear it. In the mean time, I will go ahead with this macro implementation, in case it turns out to be the best choice.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="28473" author="amalloy" created="Fri, 11 May 2012 21:52:28 -0700">&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8211; This patch subsumes all previous patches to this issue and to &lt;a href="http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-992" title="`iterate` reducer"&gt;CLJ-992&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to create an object which is both a lazy sequence and a&lt;br/&gt;
reducible source, I needed to add a macro named defseq to core_deftype.&lt;br/&gt;
It is basically a reimplementation of clojure.lang.LazySeq as a clojure&lt;br/&gt;
macro, so that I can "mix in" lazy-sequence functions into a new class&lt;br/&gt;
with whatever methods are needed for reducing and folding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we wanted, we could use this macro to implement lazy-seq in clojure instead of in java, but that's unrelated so I didn't do that in this patch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted in a previous comment, defseq may not be the right approach, but this works until something better is suggested.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="28474" author="amalloy" created="Fri, 11 May 2012 21:58:40 -0700">&lt;p&gt;I accidentally included an implementation of drop-while in this patch, which I was playing around with to make sure I understood how this all works. I guess I'll leave it in for the moment, since it works and is useful, but I can remove it, or move it to a new JIRA ticket, if it's not wanted at this time.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="28479" author="richhickey" created="Sat, 12 May 2012 08:52:52 -0700">&lt;p&gt;Ok, I think this patch is officially off the rails. There must be a better way. Let's start with: touching core/deftype and reimplementing lazy-seq as a macro are off the table. The return value of range doesn't have to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; a LazySeq, it has to be a lazy seq, .e.g. implement ISeq (7 methods, not 30) which it can do by farming out to its existing impl. It can also implement some new interface for use by the reducer logic. There is also still clojure.lang.Range still there, which is another approach. Please take an extremely conservative approach in these things.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="28480" author="amalloy" created="Sat, 12 May 2012 15:53:26 -0700">&lt;p&gt;Okay, thanks for the feedback - I'm glad I went into that last patch knowing it was probably wrong &lt;img class="emoticon" src="http://dev.clojure.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/&gt;. I thought I would need to implement the java collection interfaces that LazySeq does, eg java.util.List, in order to avoid breaking interop functions like (defn range-list &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;n&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; (ArrayList. (range n))). If it's sufficient to implement ISeq (and thus IPersistentCollection), then that's pretty manageable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's still an unpleasant chunk of boilerplate for each new source, though; would you welcome a macro like defseq if I didn't put it in core_deftype? If so, it seems like it might as well implement the interop interfaces; if not, I can skip them and implement the 7 (isn't it more like 9?) methods in ISeq, IPersistentCollection, and Seqable for each new source type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for pointing out clojure.lang.Range to me - I didn't realize we had it there. Of course with implementation inheritance it would be easy to make Range, Iteration, etc inherit from LazySeq and just extend protocols from them. But that means moving functionality out of clojure and into java, which I didn't think we'd want to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll put together a patch that just implements ISeq by hand for both of these new types, and attach it probably later today.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="28481" author="amalloy" created="Sat, 12 May 2012 17:49:45 -0700">&lt;p&gt;So I've written a patch that implements ISeq, but not the java Collections interfaces, and it mostly works but there are definitely assumptions in some parts of clojure.core and clojure.lang that assume seqs are Collections. The most obvious to me (ie, it shows up when running mvn test) is RT/toArray - it tests for Collection, but never for ISeq, implying that it's not willing to handle an ISeq that is not also a collection. Functions which rely on toArray (eg to-array and vec) now fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This patch subsumes all previous patches on this issue, but is not suitable for application because it leaves some failing tests behind - it is intended only for intermediate feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="28488" author="richhickey" created="Sun, 13 May 2012 06:50:39 -0700">&lt;p&gt;It would be a great help if, time permitting, you could please write up the issues, challenges and options you've discovered somewhere on the dev wiki (even a simple table would be fantastic). I realize this has been a challenging task, and at this point perhaps we should opt for the more modest reducers/range and reducers/iterate and leave the two worlds separate. I'd like at some point to unify range, as there are many extant ranges it would be nice to be able to fold, as we can extant vectors.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                    <comment id="28496" author="amalloy" created="Sun, 13 May 2012 11:59:42 -0700">&lt;p&gt;I've sketched out a description of the issues and options. I'm not very familiar with the dev wiki and couldn't figure out where was the right place to put this. "release.next" seems to still be about 1.4 issues, and I don't know if it's "appropriate" to create a whole new category for this. It's available &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/1586b2460329dde1c374"&gt;as a gist&lt;/a&gt; until a better home can be found for it.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                    <comment id="28458" author="jasonjckn" created="Fri, 11 May 2012 09:23:05 -0700">&lt;p&gt;Currying iterate seems useless, albeit not harmful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While implementing repeat, I couldn't use currying. Because 1-arity is already reserved for infinite repeat (&lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;n x&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;x&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;, not &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;n x&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;n&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; if currying)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about we just support currying for functions where last param is reducible?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                        <description>&lt;p&gt;if you call a single multimethod a lot in multithreaded code you get lots of contention for the lock on the multimethod. this contention slows things down a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this is due to getMethod being synchronized. it would be great if there was some fast non-locking path through the multimethod.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <comment id="28446" author="santiago" created="Fri, 11 May 2012 04:38:34 -0700">&lt;p&gt;Here's a stab in the dark attempt at rewriting MultiFn to use atoms to swap between immutable copies of its otherwise mutable state. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The four pieces of the MultiFn's state that are mutable and protected by locks are now contained in the MultiFn.State class, which is immutable and contains convenience functions for creating a new one with one field changed. An instance of this class is now held in an atom in the MultiFn called state. Changes to any of these four members are now done with an atomic swap of these State objects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The getMethod/findAndCacheBestMethod complex was rewritten to better enable the atomic logic. findAndCacheBestMethod was replaced with findBestMethod, which merely looks up the method; the caching logic was moved to getMethod so that it can be retried easily as part of the work that method does. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it was findAndCacheBestMethod seemingly had the potential to cause a stack overflow in a perfect storm of heavy concurrent modification, since it calls itself recursively if it finds that the hierarchy has changed while it has done its work. This logic is now done in the CAS looping of getMethod, so hopefully that is not even an unlikely possibility anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is still seemingly a small race here, since the check is done of a regular variable against the value in a ref. Now as before, the ref could be updated just after you do the check, but before the MultiFn's state is updated. Of course, only the method lookup part of a MultiFn call was synchronized before; it could already change after the lookup but before the method itself executed, having a stale method finish seemingly after the method had been changed. Things are no different now in general, with the atom-based approach, so perhaps this race is not a big deal, as a stale value can't persist for long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patch passes the tests and Clojure and multimethods seems to work.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

I have not been able to benchmark it vs. the old multimethod implementation, but looking at it, I would not be surprised if it is faster when the system is in a steady state.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Unlike prn, pprint doesn't flush the underlying stream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;pretty_writer currently overrides .flush with behaviour that pushes its own data, but does not flush the underlying stream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;pprint should behave similarly to prn with respect to flushing the underlying stream.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Patch should ensure that flushing happens after pprint, without introducing any additional unnecessary flushes.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-986] Adds an exit function to exit clojure process</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-986</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;There is no standard function to exit the clojure process.&lt;br/&gt;
In java implementation,we use (System/exit 0),but in other implementations(CLR), i have to use another function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not add a standard function in clojure.core?&lt;br/&gt;
For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(defn exit&lt;br/&gt;
   ([] (exit 0)&lt;br/&gt;
   (&lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;status&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; (System/exit status)))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it's useful for us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-983] proxy-super does not restore original binding if call throws exception</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-983</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;The code for proxy-call-with-super internally used by proxy-super does not handle exceptions from the call method:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(defn proxy-call-with-super &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;call this meth&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 (let &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;m (proxy-mappings this)&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    (update-proxy this (assoc m meth nil))&lt;br/&gt;
    (let &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;ret (call)&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
      (update-proxy this m)&lt;br/&gt;
      ret)))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result the following sequence behaves unexpectedly:&lt;br/&gt;
(def obj (proxy &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;java.lang.ClassLoader&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; []&lt;br/&gt;
		      (loadClass &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;cl&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; (println "enter")&lt;br/&gt;
				 (proxy-super loadClass cl))))&lt;br/&gt;
(.loadClass obj "nonexistent")&lt;br/&gt;
;; prints enter, then throws ClassNotFoundException&lt;br/&gt;
(.loadClass obj "nonexistent")&lt;br/&gt;
;; does not print anything before throwing cnfe&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A try-finally block around the invocation would solve this particular issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-982] Implement an interface? predicate to balance class?</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-982</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;clojure.core implements a class? predicate to detect if a thing is an instance of java.lang.Class. The attached patch implements interface? to further distinguish classes that are also interfaces. This gives us Clojure api for e.g., enumerating all interfaces a thing's base class implements; as in, (filter #(interface? %) (supers (class my-thing))).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-980</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;The documentation for extend-type contains the following example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;(extend-type MyType 
    Countable
      (cnt [c] ...)
    Foo
      (bar [x y] ...)
      (baz ([x] ...) ([x y &amp;amp; zs] ...)))&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;tt&gt;&lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;x y &amp;amp; zs&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is not a valid parameter list for a protocol fn. The documentation should be appropriately amended.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Edmund, how are you running this AOT code? I wrapped your code in a main function and built an uberjar from it.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="28485" author="ejackson" created="Sun, 13 May 2012 00:20:57 -0700">&lt;p&gt;Hi Scott,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have two use cases&lt;br/&gt;
1. AOT compile and call from repl.&lt;br/&gt;
My steps: git clone, lein compile, lein repl, (use 'aots.death), (in-ns 'aots.death), (= (class (Dontwork. nil)) (class (map-&amp;gt;Dontwork {:a 1}))) =&amp;gt; false&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. My original use case, which I've minimised here, is an AOT ns, producing a genclass that is called instantiated from other Java (no main).  This produces the same error. I will produce an example of this and post it too.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="28486" author="ejackson" created="Sun, 13 May 2012 02:23:46 -0700">&lt;p&gt;Hi Scott,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of it failing in the interop case: &lt;a href="https://github.com/ejackson/aotquestion2"&gt;https://github.com/ejackson/aotquestion2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The steps I'm following to compile this all up are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;git clone git@github.com:ejackson/aotquestion2.git&lt;br/&gt;
cd aotquestion2/cljside/&lt;br/&gt;
lein uberjar&lt;br/&gt;
lein install&lt;br/&gt;
cd ../javaside/&lt;br/&gt;
mvn package&lt;br/&gt;
java -jar ./target/aotquestion-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and it dies with this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ClassCastException: cljside.core.Dontwork cannot be cast to cljside.core.Dontwork&lt;br/&gt;
	at cljside.MyClass.makeDontwork(Unknown Source)&lt;br/&gt;
	at aotquestion.App.main(App.java:8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The error message is really confusing (to me, anyway), but I think its the same root problem as for the REPL case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you see when you run the above ?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="28487" author="scottlowe" created="Sun, 13 May 2012 06:41:21 -0700">&lt;p&gt;Ah, yes, looks like my initial attempt to reproduce was too simplistic. I used your second git repo, and can now confirm that it's failing for me with the same error.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="28497" author="scottlowe" created="Sun, 13 May 2012 20:35:35 -0700">&lt;p&gt;I looked into this a little further and the AOT generated code looks correct, in the sense that both code paths appear to be returning the same type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I wonder if this is really a ClassLoader issue, whereby two definitions of the same class are being loaded at different times, because that would cause the x.y.Class cannot be cast to x.y.Class exception that we're seeing here.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-978] bean unable to handle non-public classes</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-978</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Take the following Java as an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; IFoo {
  &lt;span class="code-object"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; getBar();
}

class FooImpl {
  &lt;span class="code-object"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; getBar() { &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"bar"&lt;/span&gt;; }
}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As presently implemented, &lt;tt&gt;(bean my-foo)&lt;/tt&gt; tries to invoke the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;(. #&amp;lt;Method &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; java.lang.&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; FooImpl.getBar&amp;gt; (invoke my-foo nil))&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as &lt;tt&gt;FooImpl&lt;/tt&gt; is not public, this fails:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;java.lang.IllegalAccessException: &lt;span class="code-object"&gt;Class&lt;/span&gt; clojure.core$bean$fn__1827$fn__1828 can not access a member of class FooImpl with modifiers &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
 at sun.reflect.Reflection.ensureMemberAccess (Reflection.java:65)
    java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke (Method.java:588)
    clojure.core$bean$fn__1827$fn__1828.invoke (core_proxy.clj:382)
    clojure.core$bean$v__1832.invoke (core_proxy.clj:388)
    clojure.core$bean$fn__1838$thisfn__1839$fn__1840.invoke (core_proxy.clj:406)
    clojure.lang.LazySeq.sval (LazySeq.java:42)
    clojure.lang.LazySeq.seq (LazySeq.java:60)
    clojure.lang.RT.seq (RT.java:473)&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the same thing succeeds if we call &lt;tt&gt;#&amp;lt;Method public java.lang.String Foo.getBar&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; rather than &lt;tt&gt;#&amp;lt;Method public java.lang.String FooImpl.getBar&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-976] Implement reader literal and print support for PersistentQueue data structure</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-976</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Clojure's PersistentQueue structure has been in the language for quite some time now and has found its way into a fair share of codebases. However, the creation of queues is a two step operation often of the form:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="preformattedContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;(conj clojure.lang.PersistentQueue/EMPTY :a :b :c)

;=&amp;gt; #&amp;lt;PersistentQueue clojure.lang.PersistentQueue@78d5f6bc&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A better experience might be the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="preformattedContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;#queue [:a :b :c]

;=&amp;gt; #queue [:a :b :c]

(pop #queue [:a :b :c])

;=&amp;gt; #queue [:b :c]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This syntax is proposed and discussed in the Clojure-dev group at &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/clojure-dev/GQqus5Wycno"&gt;https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/clojure-dev/GQqus5Wycno&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open question: Should the queue literal's arguments eval?  The implications of this are illustrated below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="preformattedContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;;; non-eval case
#queue [1 2 (+ 1 2)]

;=&amp;gt; #queue [1 2 (+ 1 2)]


;; eval case
#queue [1 2 (+ 1 2)]

;=&amp;gt; #queue [1 2 3]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to this open question will determine the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It's definitely better for interop where some other language implementation could be expected to handle a few literal representations, but not the evaluation of Clojure expressions.  Use a regular function if the args need evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;=&amp;gt; (defrecord A [b])
user.A
=&amp;gt; #user.A[(+ 4 5)]
#user.A{:b (+ 4 5)}
=&amp;gt; #user.A{:b (+ 4 5)}
#user.A{:b (+ 4 5)}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This continues to make sense, as otherwise queues would need to print with an extra &lt;tt&gt;(quote …)&lt;/tt&gt; form around lists — which records neatly avoid:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;=&amp;gt; (A. '(+ 4 5))
#user.A{:b (+ 4 5)}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this mean that a &lt;tt&gt;queue&lt;/tt&gt; fn (analogous to &lt;tt&gt;vector&lt;/tt&gt;, maybe) will also make an appearance?  It'd be handy for HOF usage.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

This is only one part of the total solution. This provides the read-string and printing capability. I'd like more discussion around the eval side before I get dive into the compiler.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

When needing eval inside a queue literal, embedding a #= seems more apropos.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-975] inconsistent destructuring behaviour when using nested maps </title>

                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;The way destructuring happens should not be affected by the fact that I have the same w at two-levels.&lt;br/&gt;
user&amp;gt;&amp;gt; (let &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;{{a :a b :b :as w} :c a1 :a b1 :b :as w} {:a 10 :b 20 :c {:a 30 :b 40}}&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; {:a a :b b  :b1 b1 :a1 a1})&lt;br/&gt;
{:a 30, :b 40, :b1 40, :a1 30} &amp;lt;- unexpected behaviour.....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;user&amp;gt;&amp;gt; (let &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;{{a :a b :b :as w} :c a1 :a b1 :b :as w1} {:a 10 :b 20 :c {:a 30 :b 40}}&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; {:a a :b b  :b1 b1 :a1 a1})&lt;br/&gt;
{:a 30, :b 40, :b1 20, :a1 10} &amp;lt;- expected behaviour ..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even having the :as things from both should not affet how others are destructured.. The email thread talking about the same is here&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>[CLJ-971] Jar within a jar throws a runtime error</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-971</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;I've created two jar files in my multi-project Maven setup.  The first jar is the "engine", and it includes the clojure jar in it.  The other jar is the "application".  It includes the engine and then packages itself into a one-jar jar file.  This means we have a jar within a jar: The "onejar" contains the engine jar, which in turn contains that clojure jar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then get an error in the runtime:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exception in thread "main" java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException&lt;br/&gt;

    at clojure.lang.RT.&amp;lt;clinit&amp;gt;(RT.java:316)&lt;br/&gt;
... 7 more&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See also my Stack Overflow question on this at &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7763480/making-an-executable-jar-that-evals-clojure-strings"&gt;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7763480/making-an-executable-jar-that-evals-clojure-strings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In researching it, I've found the problem lies in RT.lastModified, where it tries to determine last modified time by looking at the modified time on the jar file for Clojure.  But there's not actually a jar file, since it's embedded in another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've found that adding a null check solves the problem.  My lastModified looks like this now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;static public long lastModified(URL url, String libfile) throws Exception{&lt;br/&gt;
	if(url.getProtocol().equals("jar")) {
		ZipEntry entry = ((JarURLConnection) url.openConnection()).getJarFile().getEntry(libfile);
		if (entry != null)
			return entry.getTime();
	}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	return url.openConnection().getLastModified();&lt;br/&gt;
}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This runs successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you'd prefer, I can submit a patch, or commit directly.    &lt;/p&gt;

            <title>[CLJ-970] extend/implement parameterized types (generics)</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-970</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;When extending parameterized types, class files can track the original signatures of the superclass and super interfaces so that the original types can be obtained at run time.  This runtime reflection is used in some Java frameworks, and implementing it in Clojure can enable interop.  See &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/5efd692804df3f47/1336e591c2eedfa1"&gt;http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/5efd692804df3f47/1336e591c2eedfa1&lt;/a&gt; for examples of this request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This proposal checks the :parameters keyword in type meta information.  If a parameter is found, it is added to the class signature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-969] Symbol/keyword implements IFn for lookup but a non-collection argument produces non-intuitive results</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-969</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;('+ 1 2) ;; return 2 because it is treated as (get 1 '+ 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst this is "consistent" once you know the lookup behavior, it's confusing for Clojure newbies and it seems to be a non-useful behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proposal: modify Keyword.invoke() and Symbol.invoke() to restrict first Object argument to instanceof ILookup, Map or IPersistentSet (or null) so that the "not found" behavior doesn't produce non-intuitive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-968] ns emitting gen-class before imports results in imported annotations being discarded.</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-968</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;The following discards the imported annotations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;(ns com.example.BaseXModuleTest
  (:&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; (org.basex.query QueryModule QueryModule$Deterministic))
  (:gen-class
     :&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; org.basex.query.QueryModule
     :methods [
       [^{QueryModule$Deterministic {}}
        addOne [&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;] &lt;span class="code-object"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;]]))&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when moving the &lt;tt&gt;gen-class&lt;/tt&gt; call out of the &lt;tt&gt;ns&lt;/tt&gt; declaration, the annotation is correctly applied:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;(ns com.example.BaseXModuleTest
  (:&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; (org.basex.query QueryModule QueryModule$Deterministic)))

(gen-class
  :&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; org.basex.query.QueryModule
  :name com.example.BaseXModuleTest
  :methods [
    [^{QueryModule$Deterministic {}}
     addOne [&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;] &lt;span class="code-object"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears that imported names are not yet in-scope when gen-class is run from a &lt;tt&gt;ns&lt;/tt&gt; declaration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <comment id="28085" author="jafingerhut" created="Sat, 7 Apr 2012 07:32:23 -0700">&lt;p&gt;clj-886-improved-fix-for-ibm-jdks-patch2.txt dated Apr 7 2012 makes the tests pass with Linux + IBM JDK 1.5, as well as these other combos tested:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linux + Oracle JDK 1.7&lt;br/&gt;
Linux + IBM JDK 1.5&lt;br/&gt;
Mac OS X 10.6.8 + Oracle/Apple JDK 1.6&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still failing tests for Linux + IBM JDK 1.6.  This patch currently skips the failing tests whenever the java.vendor is "IBM Corporation" and java.version is "1.6.0", so that "ant" succeeds.  It is easy enough to modify the patch so that the failing tests are kept as a bright shining reminder.  Let me know if that would be preferred &amp;#8211; it just involves removing the function ibm-jdk16, and simplifying where it is called after replacing it with false.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                        <description>&lt;p&gt;In test-clojure/rt.clj, the test last-var-wins-for-core evaluates #'clojure.set/subset?.  This fails unless clojure.set has been loaded.  In the normal run of the test suite, this dependency is satisfied by test-clojure/core-set being loaded first.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It simply adds a require of clojure.set to test_clojure/rt.clj.  I verified that if that test was the only one, it does fail without the require, and passes with it.  I also verified that every other test file succeeds on its own without any further changes.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-961] with-redefs loses a Var's root binding if the Var is thread-bound</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-961</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;When a Var has an in-thread binding and I use with-redefs to temporarily alter its root binding, the value restored to the root binding after with-redefs is finished will not be the original root value, but the thread-local one. The problem is using deref instead of something like clojure.lang.Var's .getRawRoot to backup the original root values in with-derefs-fn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never used with-redefs and it is very unlikely that one would use it while the Vars in question are thread-bound. However, when reading the function's definition in Joy of Clojure and later in core.clj, I did not believe this behaviour was intended.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                        <description>&lt;p&gt;I've begun working on implementing SourceMaps for ClojureScript. For an overview of SourceMaps, see: &lt;a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/"&gt;http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/&lt;/a&gt; For discussion of the feature in ClojureScript, see: &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/clojure-dev/zgmXO2iM1JQ/discussion"&gt;https://groups.google.com/d/topic/clojure-dev/zgmXO2iM1JQ/discussion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to produce accurate source maps, I need column information in addition to line information from the Clojure reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've made the necessary enhancement to LispReader, etc. but have some cleanup and testing left to do. I'd also like a sanity check from the core team before attaching a formal patch. You can find my work in progress here: &lt;a href="https://github.com/brandonbloom/clojure/compare/columns"&gt;https://github.com/brandonbloom/clojure/compare/columns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-959] after call to clojure.java.shell/sh, jvm won't exit</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-959</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Create the following four-line file, shell_example.clj:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;;; simple example of call to sh that causes jvm to hang after print&lt;br/&gt;
(require '&lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;clojure.java.shell :as shell&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;
(shell/sh "ls")&lt;br/&gt;
(println "jvm should exit after this, but it doesn't")&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run:&lt;br/&gt;
java -jar clojure-1.3.0.jar shell_example.clj&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the message is printed, the jvm doesn't quit. It just sits there. I have to hit Ctrl-C to force the jvm to quit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This happens on 1.3 and the most recent code in github as of 3/26/2012. I imagine the jvm is waiting for a thread that hasn't terminated, but the code in the sh function doesn't look like it's doing anything obviously wrong. I'm too much of a newcomer to Clojure to dig any deeper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My workaround right now is to do (System/exit 0) to force the jvm to quit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your work on Clojure, it's simply an amazing language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <comment id="28023" author="jafingerhut" created="Mon, 26 Mar 2012 22:19:03 -0700">&lt;p&gt;Jeff, this occurs in any Clojure program where certain threading mechanisms are invoked.  In your case, clojure.java.shell/sh uses future, which causes threads to be created that then sit around for about 60 seconds after everything else quits, and the main Java process does not exit until that happens.  Another way to get the program to exit quickly is to call (shutdown-agents), but that isn't any more convenient than (System/exit 0), nor is there any obvious way you can tell as a newcomer that you should be doing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ticket &lt;a href="http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-124" title="GC  Issue 120: Determine mechanism for controlling automatic shutdown of Agents, with a default policy and mechanism for changing that policy as needed"&gt;CLJ-124&lt;/a&gt; is marked with status "Approved" at this time, which leads me to believe that perhaps soon there will be a change made to Clojure such that this situation will change.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                        <description>&lt;p&gt;The attached patch uses a sequence to create an iterator for persistent vectors.  It should be slightly more efficient for PersistentVector objects than repeatedly calling nth (for reasons that I outline in the commit message).  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

                        <description>&lt;p&gt;When a method defined by a protocol has multiple typehinted signatures, it is impossible to implement them using deftype because deftype throws away the typehints.  The compiler then looks for the proper signatures (i.e. with typehints) and throws an exception when it can't find them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-956] [java.lang.ClassFormatError: Duplicate method name&amp;signature] when using gen-class</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-956</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When extending a class that defines a method with the signature "public void load();", I get the following load time error:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;java.lang.ClassFormatError: Duplicate method name&amp;amp;signature&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking into javap, I see that in fact gen-class is generating two entries for the load method. Prefix does not help in this case, as the defined load method is generated anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="alternate" type="square"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Daniel&lt;/li&gt;

                    <comment id="27963" author="jafingerhut" created="Mon, 19 Mar 2012 00:58:18 -0700">&lt;p&gt;I've confirmed this behavior with 1.4.0 beta5.  I've only tracked it down as far as finding the "Can't embed object in code" message, which is easy to find in Compiler.java in method emitValue.  That exception is thrown because printString in RT.java throws an exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It isn't clear to me what should be done instead, though.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="27964" author="fogus" created="Mon, 19 Mar 2012 07:03:08 -0700">&lt;p&gt;What would it mean to construct an arbitrary Java object for the purpose of embedding it in code in a generic way? You could say that it's just a matter of calling its constructor with the right args but very often in Java that is &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; enough to make an object considered "initialize".  Sometimes there are init methods or putters or whatever that are required for object construction.  So right there I hope it's clear that even though #some.Klass&lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;&amp;quot;foo&amp;quot;&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; provides a way to call an arbitrary constructor, it's in no way a guarantee that an instance is properly constructed.  The reason that (for example) defrecords are embeddable anywhere is because we know for certain that the constructor creates a fully initialized instance. If you need to embed specific instances in your own code then you have two options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Implement a print-dup for the class that guarantees a fully initialized object is built.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use Clojure 1.4's tagged literal feature to do the same.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Quick point of note:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your code &lt;div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="preformattedContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;(defmethod print-dup java.net.URL [o, ^java.io.Writer w] (.write w (str o)))
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doesn't do what you think it does.  It spits out exactly &lt;tt&gt;&lt;a href="file:///home/hara/dj/usr/src/clojurescript/src/cljs/cljs/core.cljs"&gt;file:///home/hara/dj/usr/src/clojurescript/src/cljs/cljs/core.cljs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; that Clojure reads in as a symbol.  Something like the following might be more appropriate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="preformattedContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;(defmethod print-dup java.net.URL [o, ^java.io.Writer w] (.write w "#java.net.URL") (.write w (str [ (str o) ])))

(let [x #java.net.URL["file:///home/hara/dj/usr/src/clojurescript/src/cljs/cljs/core.cljs"]]                             
  (printf "(class x)=%s x='%s'\n" (class x) x) x)                                                                          

; (class x)=class java.net.URL x='file:/home/hara/dj/usr/src/clojurescript/src/cljs/cljs/core.cljs'

;=&amp;gt; #&amp;lt;URL file:/home/hara/dj/usr/src/clojurescript/src/cljs/cljs/core.cljs&amp;gt;

(.getProtocol *1)                        
;=&amp;gt; "file"
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="27965" author="bmillare" created="Mon, 19 Mar 2012 08:09:10 -0700">&lt;p&gt;Fogus, can you please elaborate on using clojure 1.4's tagged literal features. While I understand that you can define data-reader functions, for example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="preformattedContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;(binding [*data-readers* {'user/f (fn [x] (java.io.File. (first x)))}] (read-string "#user/f [\"hello\"]")) ;=&amp;gt; #&amp;lt;File hello&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;however, I feel this is only half a fix, compared with the first mentioned solution (involving print-dup), since clojure's tagged literals only are important for reading, not for printing. Does using tagged literals, so that (read-string (pr-str (read-string ...) works, imply that you must also define print methods per class? If this is true, it seems problematic since if different code wants to define different print methods, this will conflict since defining print-dup methods is global. Is there a good solution for printing objects depending on the context? As an alternative solution, I propose making the default print-method of all objects that didn't already have a printed representation to be a tagged literal, this way, users can customize what it means to read it. (See &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups&amp;amp;hl=en#!topic/clojure/GdT5cO6JoSQ"&gt;https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups&amp;amp;hl=en#!topic/clojure/GdT5cO6JoSQ&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="27966" author="fogus" created="Mon, 19 Mar 2012 08:18:29 -0700">&lt;p&gt;"Fogus, can you please elaborate on using clojure 1.4's tagged literal features."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can, but it falls outside of the scope of this particular ticket.  It might be better to take the broader conversation to the design page at &lt;a href="http://dev.clojure.org/display/design/Tagged+Literals"&gt;http://dev.clojure.org/display/design/Tagged+Literals&lt;/a&gt; and the clojure-dev list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has the original motivation for this ticket been addressed?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="27967" author="bmillare" created="Mon, 19 Mar 2012 08:26:00 -0700">&lt;p&gt;I think you've explained the underlying problem, so yes. One possible caveat might be that it may be a concern that the current error message is not telling that the underlying problem lies in an improperly initialized object. (or maybe it is, and that's the error message I should expect).&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-954] TAP Support in clojure.test.tap Needs Updating</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-954</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;tt&gt;testing-vars-str&lt;/tt&gt; function requires one argument, but in the &lt;tt&gt;clojure.test.tap&lt;/tt&gt; namespace it is currently called with zero arguments. This results in a &lt;tt&gt;clojure.lang.ArityException&lt;/tt&gt; when attempting to generate TAP output with &lt;tt&gt;with-tap-out&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are links to the occurrences of this in the latest commit to &lt;tt&gt;clojure.test.tap&lt;/tt&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; 1. &lt;a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/36642c984cbf52456e45a8af0a96e4b7e7417041/src/clj/clojure/test/tap.clj#L81"&gt;https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/36642c984cbf52456e45a8af0a96e4b7e7417041/src/clj/clojure/test/tap.clj#L81&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 2. &lt;a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/36642c984cbf52456e45a8af0a96e4b7e7417041/src/clj/clojure/test/tap.clj#L92"&gt;https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/36642c984cbf52456e45a8af0a96e4b7e7417041/src/clj/clojure/test/tap.clj#L92&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After fixing this particular issue in my local copy of 1.4.0-SNAPSHOT, there appear to be other problems with this code as well (e.g., not producing correct output for failing tests). Since this code appears to be unmaintained and untested, perhaps it should live outside the main Clojure repo?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                        <description>&lt;p&gt;bigdec handles java.math.BigInteger when converting to java.math.BigDecimal, but it does not handle clojure.lang.BigInt.  Instead it treats a clojure.lang.BigInt as a Number, by casting it to long.  This causes the following error:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clojure 1.4.0-beta3&lt;br/&gt;
user=&amp;gt; (bigdec (inc (bigint Long/MAX_VALUE)))&lt;br/&gt;
IllegalArgumentException Value out of range for long: 9223372036854775808  clojure.lang.RT.longCast (RT.java:1123)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Also eliminate a reflection warning in the ratio case while we are in there.  Paul's failing case has been added to tests, fails before the fix, and passes after.  Attempted to make it as run-time efficient as possible by creating a new BigInt/toBigDecimal, patterned after the existing BigInt/toBigInteger.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="27975" author="pjstadig" created="Wed, 21 Mar 2012 09:51:50 -0700">&lt;p&gt;I was originally thinking of something like &lt;tt&gt;(BigDecimal. (.toBigInteger ^clojure.lang.BigInt x))&lt;/tt&gt;.  Adding a &lt;tt&gt;toBigDecimal&lt;/tt&gt; method to &lt;tt&gt;clojure.lang.BigInt&lt;/tt&gt; saves some object allocations and such.  Probably more of a micro optimization, but it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clojure 1.4.0-master-SNAPSHOT&lt;br/&gt;

            <title>[CLJ-951] Clojure 1.3+ can't intern a dynamic var</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-951</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;In Clojure 1.3+, interned vars don't set the dynamic field in clojure.lang.Var and can't be used in a binding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;user=&amp;gt; (intern &lt;b&gt;ns&lt;/b&gt; (with-meta 'dyna-var {:dynamic true}) 100)&lt;br/&gt;
user=&amp;gt; (binding &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;dyna-var &amp;quot;one hundred&amp;quot;&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; dyna-var) &lt;br/&gt;
;=&amp;gt; IllegalStateException Can't dynamically bind non-dynamic var: user/dyna-var  clojure.lang.Var.pushThreadBindings (Var.java:339)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The var has the right metadata&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;user=&amp;gt; (meta #'dyna-var)                                      &lt;br/&gt;
;=&amp;gt; {:ns #&amp;lt;Namespace user&amp;gt;, :name dyna-var, :dynamic true}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But doesn't set the dynamic flag on the var:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;user=&amp;gt; (.isDynamic #'dyna-var)                                &lt;br/&gt;
;=&amp;gt; false&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The push-thread-bindings function looks for the .dynamic flag.  Vars created via def have it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;user=&amp;gt; (def ^:dynamic def-dyna-var 100)&lt;br/&gt;
user=&amp;gt; (.isDynamic #'def-dyna-var)&lt;br/&gt;
;=&amp;gt; true&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with the metadata&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;user=&amp;gt; (meta #'def-dyna-var)&lt;br/&gt;
{:ns #&amp;lt;Namespace user&amp;gt;, :name def-dyna-var, :dynamic true, :line 6, :file "NO_SOURCE_PATH"}&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>[CLJ-946] eval reader fail to recognize  function object </title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-946</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;(defmacro stubbing &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;stub-forms &amp;amp; body&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
  (let [stub-pairs (partition 2 stub-forms)&lt;br/&gt;
        returns (map last stub-pairs)&lt;br/&gt;
        stub-fns (map constantly returns)  ;;(map #(list 'constantly %) returns)&lt;br/&gt;
        real-fns (map first stub-pairs)]&lt;br/&gt;
    `(binding &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;~@(interleave real-fns stub-fns)&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
       ~@body)))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This macro is from  Clojure In Action , whith the commented line rewrited (I know that original is better)&lt;br/&gt;
I assumed that this macro would work as supposed , if the stub forms use compile time literal, for e.g&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(def ^:dynamic $ (fn &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;x&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; (* x 10))&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(stubbing &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;$ 1&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        ($ 1 1))&lt;br/&gt;
;; =&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;
IllegalArgumentException No matching ctor found for class clojure.core$constantly$fn__3656&lt;br/&gt;
	clojure.lang.Reflector.invokeConstructor (Reflector.java:166)&lt;br/&gt;
	clojure.lang.LispReader$EvalReader.invoke (LispReader.java:1031)&lt;br/&gt;
	clojure.lang.LispReader$DispatchReader.invoke (LispReader.java:618)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;;;macro can expanded  &lt;br/&gt;
(macroexpand-all '(stubbing &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;$ 1&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
                ($ 1 1)))&lt;br/&gt;
;; =&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;
(let* [] (clojure.core/push-thread-bindings (clojure.core/hash-map (var $) #&amp;lt;core$constantly$fn_&lt;em&gt;3656 clojure.core$constantly$fn&lt;/em&gt;_3656@161f888&amp;gt;)) (try ($ 1 1) (finally (clojure.core/pop-thread-bindings))))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought there is something wrong with eval reader, but i can't figure it out&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;btw the above code can run on clojure-clr&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>[CLJ-944] (.containsKey {:one 1} :one) throws Exception</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-944</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi guys, I am getting the following exception:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;(.containsKey {:one 1} :one)
;=&amp;gt; ClassCastException clojure.lang.PersistentArrayMap cannot be &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;cast&lt;/span&gt; to clojure.lang.PersistentHashMap&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The map is a clojure.lang.PersistentArrayMap, which obviously has a containsKey method (&lt;a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/src/jvm/clojure/lang/PersistentArrayMap.java#L95"&gt;https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/src/jvm/clojure/lang/PersistentArrayMap.java#L95&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Casting it works fine though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;(.containsKey ^clojure.lang.PersistentArrayMap {:one 1} :one)
;=&amp;gt; &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The mailing list suggest that the compiler injects an incorrect cast to clojure.lang.PersistentHashMap. In this case it should probably be cast to a clojure.lang.Associative, the highest common interface having the .containsKey method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is not present in Clojure 1.2.1.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-943] When load-lib fails, a namespace is still created</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-943</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;When requiring a namespace that doesn't compile, a namespace is still created. The attached patch removes the namespace on failure if the namespace wasn't already present on entry to load-lib. See the test case in the patch for repro instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is obviously a subset of having atomic loads. Would a step further in this direction, e.g. using a swapable state object within clojure.lang.Namespace be of interest?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-941] NullPointerException possible with seq-zip</title>

                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clojure 1.3.0&lt;br/&gt;
user=&amp;gt; (require '&lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;clojure.zip :as z&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;
nil&lt;br/&gt;
user=&amp;gt; (-&amp;gt; (z/seq-zip (list 1)) z/down z/remove)&lt;br/&gt;
NullPointerException   clojure.core/with-meta (core.clj:211)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possibly the make-node function for seq-zip should be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(fn &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;node children&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; (with-meta (or children ()) (meta node)))&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I could mechanically update it, but if you could take a look and create an updated patch yourself it would be safer.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-939] Exceptions thrown in the top level ns form are reported without file or line number</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-939</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;If there is an error in the `ns` form, an exception is thrown, which is not caught in `load`.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, with an invalid :only clause;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;(ns clj14.myns
  (:use
   [clojure.core :only seq]))&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This generates a &lt;tt&gt;Don't know how to create ISeq from: clojure.lang.Symbol&lt;/tt&gt; exception, with source file or line number.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                        <description>&lt;p&gt;I'm trying to write a macro which generate reify forms using some reflection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;clojure.reflect produces type symbols similar to 'java.util.Iterator&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the compiler doesn't accept the &amp;lt;&amp;gt; syntax in type hints:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(reify Iterable (^{:tag java.util.Iterator} iterator &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;this&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; nil)) ; works&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(reify Iterable (^{:tag java.util.Iterator&amp;lt;&amp;gt;} iterator &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;this&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; nil)) ;; fails&lt;br/&gt;
CompilerException java.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: java.util.Iterator&amp;lt;&amp;gt;, compiling:(NO_SOURCE_PATH:1325)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like the compiler should understand the &amp;lt;&amp;gt; just enough to strip it, rather than reject it. This would make it much easier to write correct macros involving type hinting and reflection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workaround I have been using is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(defn hint&lt;br/&gt;
  "clojure.reflect demarks generics with angle brackets, but&lt;br/&gt;
   the compiler does not support generics in type hints"&lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;obj tag&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
  (let &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;tag (-&amp;gt; tag .toString (.replace &amp;quot;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&amp;quot; &amp;quot;&amp;quot;) symbol)&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    (with-meta obj {:tag tag}))&lt;img class="emoticon" src="http://dev.clojure.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                        <description>&lt;p&gt;user=&amp;gt; (use 'clojure.pprint)&lt;br/&gt;
nil&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patch changes cl-format so that when E, F, or G directive is used, the corresponding arg is coerced from a clojure.lang.Ratio to a double before formatting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-936] Improve docs about argument destructuring at clojure.org</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-936</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;What:&lt;br/&gt;
Make the description of argument destructuring more visible at &lt;a href="http://clojure.org/special_forms"&gt;http://clojure.org/special_forms&lt;/a&gt;, namely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="alternate" type="square"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;add a heading such as "&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Binding Forms (Argument Destructuring)&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;" to the section describing it&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;make all occurences of "binding-form" a link to that heading, especially under the let and fn headings&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;for (fn ..) add a new second paragraph like "Regarding binding forms, also known as argument destructuring, &amp;lt;a href=#thea-new-heading&amp;gt;read more in the binding forms section&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; under the let special form."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Why:&lt;br/&gt;
It was always surprisingly difficult for me to google out the explanation of destructuring in Clojure and only today have I discovered that it is described pretty well under the let special form. Thus it should be made more visible to the readers (and preferably also search engines). (Even though Google has returned the page as one of the first matches, I had problems seeing it there - partly due to usually mistyping destructuring e.g. as deconstruction).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks a lot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: I haven't found a better way to report this, such as a commenting capability on the page itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I did want to comment that the most recent version of the Clojure cheatsheet at &lt;a href="http://clojure.org/cheatsheet"&gt;http://clojure.org/cheatsheet&lt;/a&gt; now has a link called "examples" in the "Special Forms" section that links to the 'let' section of the special forms documentation page.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-935] clojure.string/trim uses different defn of whitespace as triml, trimr</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-935</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;clojure.string/triml and trimr use Character/isWhitespace to determine whether a character is whitespace, but trim uses some other definition of white space character.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;user=&amp;gt; (use 'clojure.string)&lt;br/&gt;
nil&lt;br/&gt;
user=&amp;gt; (def s "  \u2002  foo")&lt;br/&gt;
#'user/s&lt;br/&gt;
user=&amp;gt; (trim s)&lt;br/&gt;
"?  foo"&lt;br/&gt;
user=&amp;gt; (triml s)&lt;br/&gt;
"foo"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attached patch changes trim to use Character/isWhitespace.  I suppose other possibilities are to change triml and trimr to use trim's notion of whitespace, whatever that is, or to just leave these functions inconsistent with each other.  It does seem that it would be a nice property that (trim s) is equal to (triml (trimr s)) for all strings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patch also changes triml to only call .length on s once.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                        <description>&lt;p&gt;disj! fails whenever called with multiple items to remove:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;user=&amp;gt; (-&amp;gt; #{5 10 15 20} transient (disj! 10 15) persistent!)&lt;br/&gt;
ClassCastException clojure.lang.PersistentHashSet$TransientHashSet cannot be cast to clojure.lang.IPersistentSet  clojure.core/disj (core.clj:1419)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a simple one line fix to disj! Clojure source code to correct this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                        <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;tt&gt;contains?&lt;/tt&gt; function, given a collection which is not an associative (Map, Set, String, array), returns false instead of throwing an exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a subject of confusion when people call &lt;tt&gt;contains?&lt;/tt&gt; on sequential collections like lists, and on associative collections which do not implement the &lt;tt&gt;Associative&lt;/tt&gt; interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other predicates, such as &lt;tt&gt;even?&lt;/tt&gt;, throw an exception when passed arguments of an invalid type.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-929] Accessing Java property starting with _ has issues in 1.4</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-929</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;When attempting to use interop syntax with symbols which aren't legal Java names (such as deleted?), the names are mangled a bit. That's necessary, of course, and the method of munging can be internal to the compiler. However, the behavior when munging changed a little between 1.3 and 1.4 beta1. Obviously the specifics of munging are something I should avoid relying on, but the way it changed looks like an accident or a bug even so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use-case I ran into is that defrecords contain a field named __meta for tracking their metadata. In both 1.3 and 1.4 you can get at that field with (. record __meta), which avoids munging. But on 1.3 (. record --meta) also accesses it (translating each - to a _), while on 1.4 (. record -meta) works and (. record --meta) doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, looking at line 883 of Compiler.java, it looks like this may be related to the (. foo -property) syntax ported from CLJS, and indeed (. record ---meta) works, I guess by reducing to an "old style" (. record --meta). So that clears up why --meta fails: it's looking for __meta. I'm still not clear on why (. record -meta) works, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it looks like the - prefix for properties is not 100% backwards-compatible like it seemed to be. Is this an issue we need to fix, or is the recommendation simply to never have fields that start with - or _?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

(defrecord &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;__meta&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;) actually breaks immediately, because the record mechanism itself generates a field named __meta, but any field named with a - or _ prefix has this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;user=&amp;gt; (defrecord Foo &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;-blah&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;
user.Foo&lt;br/&gt;
user=&amp;gt; (.-blah (Foo. 1))&lt;br/&gt;
IllegalArgumentException No matching field found: blah for class user.Foo  clojure.lang.Reflector.getInstanceField (Reflector.java:289)&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-927] Consider using the identity function as default tagged literal reader</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-927</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;With data reader support, it's impossible to write a program to read an arbitrary stream of Clojure forms.  For example, the following code will fail with the current 1.4.0-beta1 tagged literal support:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="preformattedContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;#point [0 2]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be enough to require that the read side define a reader for &lt;tt&gt;point&lt;/tt&gt;, but what if we do not wish to require that both sides of the conversation know about the &lt;tt&gt;#point&lt;/tt&gt; tag beforehand?  Using the &lt;tt&gt;identity&lt;/tt&gt; function as a default allows the reader to handle the literal form as is even when it doesn't recognize a tag (or even care to translate it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The change from the current behavior is that missing tagged literal parsers are no longer error conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

That would allow a program to recreate the printed representation.  A map would work as the value. You'd get something like: {:unknown-literal point :value &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;0 2&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;}.  If you needed to pass that on to some other process, you could easily write it in the original literal form.  Perhaps the key for literal tag should be namespace qualified to avoid possible confusion with user data.  Another benefit of returning a map for an unknown literal tag is that equality tests still seem reasonable:  (not= #foo "abc" #bar "abc").&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                        <description>&lt;p&gt;rand-nth throws when given an empty list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solution is to either call seq on parameter, or to supply nil as a not-found parameter in call to nth. Patch fir latter fix included.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-923] Reading ratios prefixed by + is not working</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-923</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;In general Clojure's number types can be read prefixed with either a +&lt;br/&gt;
or - and this seems to work correctly for reading integers and floats.&lt;br/&gt;
In the case of ratios however things break down when ratios are&lt;br/&gt;
prefixed with a +.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ratio pattern in LispReader.java does match on ratios starting&lt;br/&gt;
with both + and - but matchNumber fails on ratios prefixed with +&lt;br/&gt;
because it ends up calling "new BigInteger(m.group(1))" and it turns&lt;br/&gt;
out the constructor for BigInteger has no problems with negative&lt;br/&gt;
numbers but it doesn't like numbers prefixed by a +.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-919] cannot create anonymous primitive functions</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-919</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Primitive functions only work (e.g. return primitive types) when defined with `defn`.  An equivalent function created with `fn` does not behave the same way as when created with `defn`.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(definterface IPrimitiveTester&lt;br/&gt;
   (getType &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;^int x&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;
   (getType &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;^long x&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;
   (getType &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;^float x&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;
   (getType &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;^double x&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;
   (getType &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;^Object x&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(deftype PrimitiveTester []&lt;br/&gt;
   IPrimitiveTester&lt;br/&gt;
   (getType &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;this ^int x&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; :int)&lt;br/&gt;
   (getType &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;this ^long x&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; :long)&lt;br/&gt;
   (getType &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;this ^float x&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; :float)&lt;br/&gt;
   (getType &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;this ^double x&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; :double)&lt;br/&gt;
   (getType &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;this ^Object x&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; :object))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(defmacro pt &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;x&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
   `(.getType (PrimitiveTester.) ~x))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(defn with-defn ^double &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;^double x&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
   (+ x 0.5))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(pt (with-defn 1.0)) ; =&amp;gt; :double&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(let [a (fn ^double &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;^double x&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; (+ x 0.5))] &lt;br/&gt;
  (pt (a 0.1))) ; =&amp;gt; :object &lt;/p&gt;

            <title>[CLJ-916] into loses metadata</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-916</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;The into fn loses metadata.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm seeing some team members (myself included) rely on metadata. Metadata has been incredibly useful in some cases, however the silent destruction of metadata by core clojure fns (into, walk, etc) have been a source of increasing complexity and confusion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A team member could start relying on a 3rd party library that used 'into'. Actually, the into fn could essentially be added to the code base at any time in many ways. Wrt metadata the potential for incidental complexity increases exponentially as more developers and libraries enter the mix. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons Clojure has worked for us so well is because it has greatly reduced incidental complexity.&lt;br/&gt;
IMHO the 'into metadata bug' seriously limits the usefulness of metadata and would love to see the into fn fixed in 1.4.&lt;/p&gt;

If true, then one way to fix this ticket is to implement metadata for transients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there any fundamental reasons why it would be difficult to add metadata to transients, as long as the metadata itself was immutable?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="27958" author="jafingerhut" created="Fri, 16 Mar 2012 02:57:42 -0700">&lt;p&gt;First rough cut of a patch that makes not only into, but also select-keys, clojure.set/project, and clojure.set/rename preserve metadata.  Added tests for these and many other functions.  Still some open questions about other functions not tested in comments.  This patch does not attempt to make transients preserve metadata.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-911] 'proxy' prevents overriding Object.finalize (and doesn't document it)</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-911</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;It appears to be impossible to override Object.finalize() using proxy.  If the method is defined using proxy, then it cannot be called straightforwardly (see below), and it is not called as a finalizer during normal program execution (not demonstrated below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See extensive discussion at: &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/a1e2fca45af6c1af"&gt;https://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/a1e2fca45af6c1af&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;user=&amp;gt; (def m (proxy &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;java.util.HashMap&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; []&lt;br/&gt;
        (finalize []&lt;br/&gt;
          ;(proxy-super finalize)&lt;br/&gt;
          (prn "finalizing..."))&lt;br/&gt;
        (hashCode []&lt;br/&gt;
          99)))&lt;br/&gt;
#'user/m&lt;br/&gt;
user=&amp;gt; (.hashCode m)&lt;br/&gt;
99&lt;br/&gt;
user=&amp;gt; (.finalize m)&lt;br/&gt;
IllegalArgumentException No matching field found: finalize for class user.proxy$java.util.HashMap$0 clojure.lang.Reflector.getInstanceField (Reflector.java:289)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is at least one of two bugs here (thanks to Cedric Greevey for summarising this way):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If the inability to override finalize() is unintentional, that's a bug.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If it's intentional for some reason, then (a) that's not documented, and (b) the failure is silent, in the sense that an explicit call produces an apparently completely unrelated error (above), and the failure to call the method during object finalization is completely silent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <title>[CLJ-909] Make LineNumberingPushbackReader's buffer size configurable</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-909</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;In some situations, it's necessary to configure the buffer size of LineNumberingPushbackReader's wrapped java.io.LineNumberReader, that gets created in the constructor. A concrete problem case is where you want to avoid doing reads from the underlying Reader whenever possible, so using a buffer size of 1 makes it a bit lazier. I can also imagine cases where you'd want to &lt;b&gt;increase&lt;/b&gt; the buffer from java.io.BufferedReader's 8192-char default, but I haven't dealt with that one directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's no good way to do this by subclassing LineNumberingPushbackReader, since all the action happens in the constructors: those of java.io.LineNumberReader and the superclass of LineNumberingPushbackReader, which is java.io.PushbackReader. So my current workaround is to copy the entirety of LineNumberingPushbackReader, change the name, and add a constructor. Having LineNumberingPushbackReader support this directly would be great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both java.io.LineNumberReader and java.io.PushbackReader have constructors that accept the buffer size as the second argument, so it seems very reasonable to me to add a similar constructor for LineNumberingPushbackReader.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Turns out my current workaround to get around the lack of this ability has a problem: LispReader depends on the concrete LineNumberingPushbackReader class to be able to call .getLineNumber (via instanceof / casting). So the similar (read: nearly-copied) class I'm trying to use can't store line numbers, which makes the stack trace less nice (fwiw, this is in REPL-y: &lt;a href="https://github.com/trptcolin/reply"&gt;https://github.com/trptcolin/reply&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be nice to have an interface (ILineNumberingPushbackReader?) that declares getLineNumber, readLine, and atLineStart,  and have things check instanceof on that instead of the concrete class. That way, anyone else adhering to the LineNumberingPushbackReader contract (in order to bind that to &amp;#42;in&amp;#42; as the docstring for `clojure.main/repl` prescribes) can do it and have line numbering play nicely with the Clojure reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that sounds desirable, I can replace this patch. The existing patch will also work fine if we want to keep things concrete, or if that feels enough like solving a different problem to require another ticket.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-908] Functions with metadata print poorly</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-908</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;1.3 removed the metadata slot on most functions, and made &lt;tt&gt;.withMeta&lt;/tt&gt; return a new wrapping function that provides metadata. This changes the way functions with metadata print: instead of &lt;tt&gt;#&amp;lt;user$eval595$fn_&lt;em&gt;596 user$eval595$fn&lt;/em&gt;_596@3d48ff04&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; we now see &lt;tt&gt;#&amp;lt; clojure.lang.AFunction$1@581de498&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. I might argue that we should "lie" and print the class of the original wrapped function since it's more useful than AFunction$1, but that's debatable. The two things I propose changing are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;When &lt;tt&gt;&amp;#42;print-meta&amp;#42;&lt;/tt&gt; is true, we should print the metadata map for functions. That nothing prints implies there is no metadata, which can make it difficult to track down bugs related to metadata on functions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Remove the errant space at the front of the printed representation of functions with meta, changing &lt;tt&gt;#&amp;lt; clojure.lang.AFunction$1@581de498&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;#&amp;lt;clojure.lang.AFunction$1@581de498&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. The cause of this issue is that &lt;tt&gt;.getSimpleName&lt;/tt&gt; on an object with an anonymous class returns &lt;tt&gt;""&lt;/tt&gt;, and we print that followed by a space and its &lt;tt&gt;.toString&lt;/tt&gt;. My fix is to omit the extra space if the class has no simple name; this would cause instances of other anonymous (non-function) classes to print more nicely as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If it would be desirable to print the class of the original "wrapped" function, then I can easily add another patch for that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Records only support typehints to enable performant storage of primitive types like ints, not to provide static typing in general. An Object is stored the same way as a String, so there's no need to pay attention to that typehint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functions behave the same way: ((fn &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;^String x&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; x) :test) works just fine. Only if you use a member method of the hinted type (such as .substring in this example) is an exception thrown then the compiler casts to String in order to call the method.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="27524" author="chip" created="Tue, 10 Jan 2012 15:08:54 -0800">&lt;p&gt;I don't understand how you get from "this is how it is" to "this is how it is meant to be."  The compiler can do a better job if the underlying field is properly typed: Type errors can be caught sooner, and cast operations can be omitted on use.  This is a worthy enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following works as expected:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(defprotocol Foo (act &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;this&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;))&lt;br/&gt;
(defrecord Fred []&lt;br/&gt;
  Foo&lt;br/&gt;
  (act &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;this&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; (println "done.")))&lt;br/&gt;
(defrecord Bar &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;x&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; ; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;== Field name is the DIFFERENT than method name&lt;br/&gt;
  Foo&lt;br/&gt;
  (act &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;this&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; (act (Fred.))))&lt;br/&gt;
(act (Bar. &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;1 2 3&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Produces:&lt;br/&gt;
"done."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following also works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(defprotocol Foo (act &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;this&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;))&lt;br/&gt;
(defrecord Fred [])&lt;br/&gt;
(defrecord Bar &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;act&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;) ; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;== Field name is the same as method name&lt;br/&gt;
(extend-protocol Foo&lt;br/&gt;
  Fred&lt;br/&gt;
  (act &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;this&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; (println "done."))&lt;br/&gt;
  Bar&lt;br/&gt;
  (act &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;this&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; (act (Fred.))))&lt;br/&gt;
(act (Bar. &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;1 2 3&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;))&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-905] clojure.string/replace-first treats \ and $ specially when match is a string, unlike clojure.string/replace</title>

                        <description>&lt;p&gt;clojure.string/replace only gives special treatment to replacement string when match is a regex pattern.  clojure.string/replace-first does so in those cases, but also when match is a string to be matched literally.  For example, these cases are not consistent with each other:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;user=&amp;gt; (require '&lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;clojure.string :as str&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;
nil&lt;br/&gt;
user=&amp;gt; (str/replace "food" "o" "$")&lt;br/&gt;
"f$$d"&lt;br/&gt;
user=&amp;gt; (str/replace-first "food" "o" "$")&lt;br/&gt;
java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: String index out of range: 1 (NO_SOURCE_FILE:0)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                        <description>&lt;p&gt;In various places Clojure accepts classnames as &lt;tt&gt;String&lt;/tt&gt;, eg. in &lt;tt&gt;gen-class&lt;/tt&gt; or type hints. However it does not in &lt;tt&gt;extend-protocol&lt;/tt&gt;. This does not allow simple specification of array types.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>[CLJ-902] doc macro broken for namespaces</title>

                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clojure 1.3.0&lt;br/&gt;
user=&amp;gt; (doc clojure.pprint)&lt;br/&gt;
ClassNotFoundException clojure.pprint  java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run (URLClassLoader.java:366)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears it is not safe to call resolve on a symbol representing a namespace; you get the error above. FWIW, I seem to have resolved the problem (see attached diff) by moving the find-ns clause above the resolve clause (in the cond); also the reference to namespace-doc needs to be var-quoted since namespace-doc is private. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-900] Document defonce-like behavior of defmulti</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-900</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Since Clojure 1.2 defmulti behaves similarly to defonce. This fact, and how one deals with it when doing interactive development, does not seem to be documented anywhere. This issue pops up fairly regularly in the #clojure channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commit that introduced the change: &lt;a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojure/commit/1b8d5001ba094053b24c55829994785be422cfbf"&gt;https://github.com/clojure/clojure/commit/1b8d5001ba094053b24c55829994785be422cfbf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can volunteer to update the docstrings and (if I get access to it) the clojure.org page.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <comment id="27576" author="tavisrudd" created="Mon, 16 Jan 2012 10:17:31 -0800">&lt;p&gt;Alan Malloy raises a good point in the google group discussion (&lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/clojure/XvJUzaY1jec/aVpWBicwGhsJ"&gt;https://groups.google.com/d/msg/clojure/XvJUzaY1jec/aVpWBicwGhsJ&lt;/a&gt;) about accidental confusion between trailing (or floating) and leading colons:&lt;br/&gt;
"It isn't even as simple as "letting them&lt;br/&gt;
be whitespace", because presumably you want (read-string "{a: b}") to&lt;br/&gt;
result in (hash-map 'a 'b), but (read-string "{a :b}") to result in&lt;br/&gt;
(hash-map 'a :b)."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue could be avoided by only treating a colon as whitespace when followed by a comma. As easy cut-paste of json seems the be the key motivation here, the commas are going to be there anyway: valid {"v":, 1234} vs syntax error {a-key: should-be-a-keyword}.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

I was typing faster than I was thinking and put the comma in the wrong place.  In my head I meant the form following the colon would have to have a comma after it. Thus, {"a-json-key": 1234, ...} would be valid while {"a-json-key": was-supposed-to-be-a-keyword "another-json-key" foo} would complain about the colon being an Invalid Token.  I don't see the need for it, however.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <comment id="27879" author="solussd" created="Mon, 27 Feb 2012 08:55:26 -0800">&lt;p&gt;Clojure already has reader syntax for a map. If we support JSON, do we also support ruby map literals? Seems like this addition would only add confusion, imo, given colons are used in keywords and keywords are frequently used in maps - e.g., when de-serializing from XML, or even JSON. &lt;img class="emoticon" src="http://dev.clojure.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="27880" author="dnolen" created="Mon, 27 Feb 2012 09:19:53 -0800">&lt;p&gt;Clojure is no longer a language hosted only on the JVM. Clojure is also hosted on the CLR, and JavaScript. In particular ClojureScript can't currently easily deal with JSON literals - an extremely common (though problematic) data format. By allowing colon whitespace in map literals - Clojure data structures can effectively become an extensible JSON superset - giving the succinctness of JSON and the expressiveness of XML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;+1 from me.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-897] deftype error message is misleading not useful</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-897</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you forget to include the argument vector for deftype, i.e.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(deftype second-request-handler&lt;br/&gt;
  HttpServer.RequestHandler&lt;br/&gt;
  (canRespond &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;this request&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; true)&lt;br/&gt;
  (getResponse &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;this request&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; nil))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which should be...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(deftype second-request-handler []&lt;br/&gt;
  HttpServer.RequestHandler&lt;br/&gt;
  (canRespond &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;this request&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; true)&lt;br/&gt;
  (getResponse &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;this request&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; nil))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get the error message..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't know how to create ISeq from: clojure.lang.Symbol (main.clj:1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When in fact the error is coming from (second-request-handler.clj:3). Can this error message be improved and give the actually location of the error?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The attached patch removes the destructuring form (but keeps the nice syntax in :arglists) and adds a vector? check to validate-fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All tests pass, and the example above now errors with "AssertionError No fields vector given."&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-896] Make browse-url aware of xdg-open</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-896</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;clojure.java.browse/browse-url tests to see if it's running on Mac OS to fall back to "/usr/bin/open" in order&lt;br/&gt;
to open a URI. On most other systems it'll just falls through to open-url-in-swing instead. The attached patch&lt;br/&gt;
tests to see if freedesktop.org's "xdg-open" is present in the users path. This way browse-url will launch the&lt;br/&gt;
program associated with the URI, in my case chromium.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
                <environment>All platforms that provide xdg-open (as part of freedesktop.org) benefit from this. Fix was tested on OpenBSD.</environment>

                    <comment id="27885" author="jafingerhut" created="Tue, 28 Feb 2012 16:19:08 -0800">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-920" title="Adds support for FreeDesktop&amp;#39;s xdg-open in clojure.java.browse/browse-url."&gt;&lt;del&gt;CLJ-920&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, if not identical, at least bears a significant resemblance to this ticket.  It would be good to see if the patch for one of them fixes both issues.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="27889" author="jafingerhut" created="Wed, 29 Feb 2012 11:18:04 -0800">&lt;p&gt;clj-896-browse-url-uses-xdg-open-patch2.txt is based more on the patch attached to &lt;a href="http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-920" title="Adds support for FreeDesktop&amp;#39;s xdg-open in clojure.java.browse/browse-url."&gt;&lt;del&gt;CLJ-920&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Jeremy Heiler than on the earlier patch attached to this ticket.  He and I have signed CAs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this patch improves on both of the previous patches for &lt;a href="http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-896" title="Make browse-url aware of xdg-open"&gt;CLJ-896&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-920" title="Adds support for FreeDesktop&amp;#39;s xdg-open in clojure.java.browse/browse-url."&gt;&lt;del&gt;CLJ-920&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  In particular, Jeremy's worked fine, but it caused a long slowdown in the running of tests when building Clojure.  This one does not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tested on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mac OS X 10.6.8&lt;br/&gt;
Windows XP SP3, both in cmd.exe and a Cygwin bash shell&lt;br/&gt;
Ubuntu 10.04 LTS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be great if someone could test it on a BSD system.  The only possible issue I can think of is whether the output of the "which" command is different there than on the Linux system I tested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone wants to make a patch that doesn't use "which", but instead checks the PATH, I'd recommend they also test on Windows in cmd.exe to make sure it works correctly there.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-893] crafted `vec' call allows created vector to be mutated</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-893</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;user&amp;gt; (let [a (to-array (repeat 31 0)), v (vec a)]
        [(v 2) (&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; (aset a 2 'no) (v 2))])
[0 no]
user&amp;gt; (let [a (to-array (repeat 33 0)), v (vec a)]
        [(v 2) (&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; (aset a 2 'no) (v 2))])
[0 0]&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a relaxation of &lt;b&gt;when&lt;/b&gt; different changes to the environment are made may impact the resulting value of the vector, as it is with lazy seqs, it oughtn't be possible to get two different results for the same access, just as with lazy seqs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <comment id="27436" author="stu" created="Fri, 9 Dec 2011 07:34:12 -0800">&lt;p&gt;The code path followed here lets vec assume (without copying) a passed-in array. to-array just returns the array, and createOwning doesn't copy either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seems like we need a defensive copy somewhere&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="27605" author="richhickey" created="Sun, 22 Jan 2012 10:26:10 -0800">&lt;p&gt;Just document that, when passed an array, vec aliases it, and it should not be changed. Then only people that can't ensure that must copy it first.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                    <comment id="27994" author="stuart.sierra" created="Fri, 23 Mar 2012 07:00:14 -0700">&lt;p&gt;I think the docstring in the 24/Feb/12 patch is too long. Also not entirely correct: calling &lt;tt&gt;vec&lt;/tt&gt; on a mutable java.util.List, for example, will create an immutable vector from the contents of the List.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead just say that Java arrays may be aliased by &lt;tt&gt;vec&lt;/tt&gt; and should not be modified.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="28015" author="jafingerhut" created="Mon, 26 Mar 2012 15:16:36 -0700">&lt;p&gt;clj-893-doc-vec-aliases-java-array-patch2.txt of Mar 26, 2012 is shorter than the previous attempt, and avoids the error Stuart Sierra found.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                    <comment id="28144" author="jafingerhut" created="Sat, 14 Apr 2012 14:22:41 -0700">&lt;p&gt;Would someone better at writing Clojure style doc strings take a crack at this?  I'm too verbose.  I have added a (verbose) note about this behavior on clojuredocs.org.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="28221" author="brentonashworth" created="Sat, 21 Apr 2012 14:12:00 -0700">&lt;p&gt;Added patch&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;clj-893-doc-vec-aliases-java-array-patch3.txt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this patch the doc string would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;Creates a &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; vector containing the contents of coll. Java arrays
will be aliased and should not be modified.&lt;/pre&gt;

            <title>[CLJ-891] make (symbol foo "bar") work with foo being a namespace</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-891</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;I've run across the need to do (symbol &lt;b&gt;ns&lt;/b&gt; "bar") a few times, and the existing approach (symbol (name (ns-name &lt;b&gt;ns&lt;/b&gt;)) "bar") just doesn't seem like it ought to be the only way to do the job.  Includes a patch to make this work, by adding a new arity to Symbol.intern().&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some discussion on this idea, here: &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/clojure/n25aZ5HA7hc/discussion"&gt;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/clojure/n25aZ5HA7hc/discussion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Doing a lot of cross language work, it would be great to have protocols for "I have a name" and for "I have a namespace".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With such protocols in place, it would also be possible to separately consider implementing symbol et al in terms of them. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="27443" author="hiredman" created="Fri, 9 Dec 2011 10:24:06 -0800">&lt;p&gt;Named being a protocol or an interface seems orthogonal to being able to create a symbol qualified with a namespace when you have a namespace in hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think the patch goes far enough, not only should (symbol &lt;b&gt;ns&lt;/b&gt; "foo") be supported, but also (symbol &lt;b&gt;ns&lt;/b&gt; 'foo), given that (symbol 'foo) works and (symbol "foo") works, (symbol 'bar 'foo) should also work, but doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if Named is a protocol, and if you extend it to String, and if you make the symbol function create symbols from one or two Named things you still end up having to do (symbol (ns-name &lt;b&gt;ns&lt;/b&gt;) 'foo) or (symbol (ns-name &lt;b&gt;ns&lt;/b&gt;) "foo")&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="27480" author="joegallo" created="Fri, 16 Dec 2011 14:18:02 -0800">&lt;p&gt;Stuart, I'm not opposed to the idea of separate protocols for Named and Namespaced.  Where should I go about creating a proposal to create those protocols and get them into clojure?  I'm interested in doing the leg-work, or being a part of it.  But as an outsider, I don't know what to do next &amp;#8211; creating a ticket in Jira exhausted my knowledge of the process.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="27901" author="franks" created="Fri, 2 Mar 2012 14:53:07 -0800">&lt;p&gt;The same enhancement that joe suggests for symbol, would also apply to keyword.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See: &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/222e4abc16df8b20"&gt;http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/222e4abc16df8b20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably same/similar solution applies to both issues.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>[CLJ-889] Specifically allow '.' inside keywords</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-889</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;The documentation for keywords (on page &lt;a href="http://clojure.org/reader"&gt;http://clojure.org/reader&lt;/a&gt;) specifically states that '.' is not allowed as part of a keyword name; however '.' is specifically useful.  For example, several web frameworks for Clojure use keywords to represent HTML elements, using CSS selector syntax (i.e., :div.important is equivalent to &amp;lt;div class='important'&amp;gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, the use of '.' is not checked by the reader and it is generally useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to see '.' officially allowed (in the documentation).  Further, I'd like to see additional details about which punctuation characters are allowed (my own web framework uses '&amp;amp;', '?' and '&amp;gt;' inside keywords for various purposes ... again, current reader implementation does not forbid this, but if a future reader will reject it, I'd like to know now).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-888] defprotocol should throw error when signatures include variable number of parameters</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-888</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;I tried to use &amp;amp; in the signature for a method in defprotocol. Apparently (see below), this is compiled so that &amp;amp; becomes a simple parameter name, and there is no special handling for variable number of parameters. I think the use of &amp;amp; in a protocol signature ought to be detected and immediately cause an exception (I also think this restriction on the signatures ought to be documented; I couldn't find it specified in the current documentation, though of course it is implied (as I later realized) by the fact that defprotocol creates a Java interface).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;user=&amp;gt; (defprotocol Applier (app &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;this f &amp;amp; args&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;))&lt;br/&gt;
Applier&lt;br/&gt;
user=&amp;gt; (deftype A [] Applier (app &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;_ f &amp;amp; args&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; (prn f &amp;amp; args) (apply f args)))&lt;br/&gt;
user.A&lt;br/&gt;
user=&amp;gt; (app (A.) + 1 2)&lt;br/&gt;
#&amp;lt;core$&lt;em&gt;PLUS&lt;/em&gt; clojure.core$&lt;em&gt;PLUS&lt;/em&gt;@5d9d0d20&amp;gt; 1 2&lt;br/&gt;

            <title>[CLJ-884] Reflector error messages can be improved when no matching method is found.</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-884</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;When accessing a java method with an arity mismatch or a mismatched parameter type, Reflector.java returns the following error on REPL:&lt;br/&gt;
IllegalArgumentException No matching method found: xyz for class com.abc.MyClass&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;eventhough method xyz might exist on MyClass, but was being called with the wrong number of arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attached is a patch that fixes that problem.&lt;/p&gt;

It is preferred by Clojure team that patches are in git format-patch format.  Instructions for producing such a patch are given at &lt;a href="http://clojure.org/patches"&gt;http://clojure.org/patches&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rahul, are you planning to sign a Clojure Contributor Agreement?  Without that, this code cannot be included in Clojure, unless a contributor reimplements it on their own.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-883] Clojure head holding bug 				</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-883</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;I've a head holding problem that I believe is a bug in clojure 1.3.  I&lt;br/&gt;
wrote the following function to split a a lazy seq of strings across&lt;br/&gt;
files of x size:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="preformattedContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;(defn split-file
 ([path strs size]
    (trampoline split-file path (seq strs) size 0))
 ([path strs size part]
    (with-open [f (clojure.java.io/writer (str path "." part))]
      (loop [written 0, ss strs]
        (when ss
          (if (&amp;gt;= written size)
            #(split-file path ss size (inc part))
            (let [s (first ss)]
              (.write f s)
              (recur (+ written (.length s)) (next ss)))))))))
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I call the 3 arg version of the function:&lt;br/&gt;
(split-file "foo" (repeat 100000000 "blah blah blah") 100000000)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see memory usage increases as I'm writing each file with the usual&lt;br/&gt;
gc slow down, then memory usage goes back down again as I get to a new&lt;br/&gt;
split file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memory usage is fine if I call the 4 arg version (which only writes&lt;br/&gt;
one part of the split file):&lt;br/&gt;
(split-file "foo" (repeat 100000000 "blah blah blah") 100000000 0)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can also avoid the head holding problem by removing trampoline and&lt;br/&gt;
recursively calling split-file directly, but then those recursive&lt;br/&gt;
calls use up stack and don't close files until all calls complete&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It's zust the garbage collector that doesn't collect the seq right away. If there were problems, then you would get a OutOfMemoryError pretty fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;compare&lt;br/&gt;
(split-file "foo" (repeat 100000000 "blah blah blah") 100000000 0)&lt;br/&gt;
with&lt;br/&gt;
(doall (repeat 100000000 "blah blah blah"))&lt;br/&gt;
to see the difference&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-881] Problem with the "cl-format" function from the clojure.pprint</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-881</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Let's see the following scenario:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;vdim@home:~/clojure$ git log -1&lt;br/&gt;
commit ba930d95fc3a4a78c5bd6756ea483c9dac681618&lt;br/&gt;
Author: Rich Hickey &amp;lt;richhickey@gmail.com&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Date:   Sun Oct 30 10:44:55 2011 -0400&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    inline equiv in variadic =&lt;br/&gt;
vdim@home:~/clojure$ rlwrap java -cp clojure-1.4.0-master-SNAPSHOT.jar clojure.main&lt;br/&gt;
Clojure 1.4.0-master-SNAPSHOT&lt;br/&gt;
user=&amp;gt; (use 'clojure.pprint)&lt;br/&gt;
nil&lt;br/&gt;
user=&amp;gt; (cl-format nil "~12,10F" 1.00000000074)&lt;br/&gt;
"1.0000000007"&lt;br/&gt;
user=&amp;gt; (cl-format nil "~12,10F" 1.00000000076)&lt;br/&gt;
NumberFormatException For input string: "10000000007"  java.lang.NumberFormatException.forInputString (NumberFormatException.java:65)&lt;br/&gt;
user=&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The exception is caused from round-str function (cl-format.clj) where&lt;br/&gt;
my number (100000000076) is coerced to an Integer (see line with Integer/valueOf code&lt;br/&gt;
into this function).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this normal behaviour?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See patch with tests and my suggestion for solving this problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I also changed his implementation of function inc-s so that it should allocate a bit less memory, and removed an addition of a redundant test case that is in his patch.  There is a bug he has found here, and I've verified that this patch fixes it.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-880] syntax-quote should be a macro instead of implemented inside the reader</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-880</link>

                        <description>&lt;p&gt;syntax-quote is currently a somewhat gnarly bit of java code in LispReader.java, would be great to replace it with a (hopefully less gnarly) clojure macro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LispReader.java would be required to do something similar to 'x =&amp;gt; (quote x). `x =&amp;gt; (syntax-quote x) , ~x =&amp;gt; (unquote x), ~@x =&amp;gt; (unquote-splicing x)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-878] DispatchReader always calls CtorReader when no dispatch macro found</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-878</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;At the REPL, I accidentally typed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;user=&amp;gt; # "\w+"&lt;br/&gt;
RuntimeException Unsupported escape character: \w  clojure.lang.Util.runtimeExce&lt;br/&gt;
ption (Util.java:156)&lt;br/&gt;
#&amp;lt;core$&lt;em&gt;PLUS&lt;/em&gt; clojure.core$&lt;em&gt;PLUS&lt;/em&gt;@6b7dc78&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the confusing result (the REPL is also left in an unclosed string). After looking at LispReader.java, it seems to me DispatchReader ought to at least check for whitespace before calling CtorReader (perhaps better would be to check for a valid symbol character). Another example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;user=&amp;gt; (defrecord X &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;x&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;
user.X&lt;br/&gt;
user=&amp;gt; # "user.X"&lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;5&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
#user.X{:x 5}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm assuming the fact that the above successfully creates an X is accidental.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                        <description>&lt;p&gt;The attached patch gives the programmer the option of referring to the division function in namespaces other than just clojure.core.  For example,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(ns foo&lt;br/&gt;
  (:require &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;cljs.core :as core&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;))&lt;br/&gt;
(apply core// '(1 2 3))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above lines do not compile without this patch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-870] clojure.string/replace behaves unexpectedly when \ or $ are part of the result string</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-870</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;clojure.string/replace uses javas replace function to do it's work, the replace function has the tricky habit of 'double evaluating' the replacement string (third argument). This means that every \ in the string (so i.e. "&lt;br clear="all" /&gt;") is evaluated by the java code behind replace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this behavior isn't documented it can lead to confusing errors, for example (made up semi real world example to explain the issue):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="preformattedContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;(clojure.string/replace "c:/windows/" #"/" "\\")&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should replace all unix folder separators with windows separators, this crashes with a index out of bound exemption since java tries to evaluate "&lt;br clear="all" /&gt;" as a semi regexp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="preformattedContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;(println (str "\"" (clojure.string/replace "my string with \\ and \" in it" #"[\"\\]" (fn [x] (str "\\" x))) "\""))&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The expected result would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="preformattedContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;"my string with \\ and \" in it"&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;the actual result is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="preformattedContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;"my string with \ and " in it"&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should return an 'escaped' string, it does not since the 'double evaluation' of the return string results in \\\\ being reduced to &lt;br clear="all" /&gt; again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="preformattedContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;(println (str "\"" (clojure.string/replace "my string with \\ and \" in it" #"[\"\\]" (fn [x] (str  "\\\\"  (if (= x "\\") "\\") x))) "\""))&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which is horribly ugly since you need to hand escape the backslash or it crashes.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                    <comment id="27511" author="amalloy" created="Thu, 5 Jan 2012 18:30:04 -0800">&lt;p&gt;No hand-escaping is necessary, just use #(java.util.regex.Matcher/quoteReplacement %).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I see, we're talking about when you use a function as a replacement, not a replacement &lt;b&gt;string&lt;/b&gt; like "&lt;br clear="all" /&gt;x" - the function's output should not be interpreted as regex replacement, I agree. Looks like it just needs a small patch in clojure.string/replace-by.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-867] Records of different types with the same data have the same hashcodes, even though they are not considered to be equal</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-867</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Records which contain the same field values are not considered to be equal, but the record type is not currently included in the hash.  This means that if an heterogenous map contains records of different types, where the fields aren't necessarily distinct, there is a high likelyhood of hash collisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I propose that the record type should be included in the hash code algorithm for records.  There should be no expectation that unequal records of different types should have the same hash-code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;user=&amp;gt; (hash (-&amp;gt;A 1))&lt;br/&gt;
1013911913&lt;br/&gt;
user=&amp;gt; (hash (-&amp;gt;B 1))&lt;br/&gt;
1013911913&lt;br/&gt;
user=&amp;gt; (= (&lt;del&gt;&amp;gt;A 1) (&lt;/del&gt;&amp;gt;B 1))&lt;br/&gt;
false&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This issue also affects ClojureScript.  But see &lt;a href="#CLJS-97"&gt;CLJS-97&lt;/a&gt;, as ClojureScript also has an issue with record equality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-865] Macroexpansion discards &amp;form metadata</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-865</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;As discussed in &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/2690cb6ca0e8beb8"&gt;http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/2690cb6ca0e8beb8&lt;/a&gt; there is a "surprise factor" when type-hinting an expression that represents a macro, such as with (.length ^String (doto (identity "x") prn)). Here the doto macro discards the metadata on &amp;amp;form, causing a reflective lookup. This has the effect that while expressions representing function calls can be type-hinted, expressions representing macros in general cannot. The doto macro could be rewritten to respect its &amp;amp;form metadata, but doing this for every macro in existence would be tedious and error-prone. Instead, I propose a change to the compiler, to cause macroexpansion to hang onto the metadata automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first patch attached adds a test for the behavior I propose: this test fails. After applying the second patch, the test passes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple points that merit further consideration before accepting my patch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="alternate" type="square"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I'm not sure I actually got the Java code formatted correctly. My editor is not well-configured to get the clojure/core style right automatically.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;My solution is to take the &amp;amp;form metadata, drop :line/:file keys, and then merge with the returned metadata, with &amp;amp;form taking precedence. I'm not sure whether this is the right approach in all cases, even though it works for :tag metadata.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I achieved this with a change to the compiler, which makes it fairly heavy-weight. It should be possible to instead adjust defmacro if changes to the compiler are not desirable. However, I believe this would involve substantially more work and be harder to test (for example, multiple arities complicate things). It seems nicer to treat the macroexpansion as a black box and then make metadata tweaks to the result, rather than modifying their actual defmacro code.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If a macro expands to something that is not an IObj, such as an Integer, then my patch silently discards the caller's metadata. Would it be better to throw an exception?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                    <comment id="27176" author="amalloy" created="Thu, 27 Oct 2011 23:12:50 -0700">&lt;p&gt;So I went ahead and did the work of making this change in clojure.core/defmacro instead of clojure.lang.Compiler/macroexpand1. It was even worse than I expected: I didn't realize we don't yet have syntax-quote or apply at this stage in bootstrapping, so writing a non-trivial macroexpansion requires a huge amount of (list `foo (list `bar 'local-name)) and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm sure the version I wrote is not optimal, but it seemed simpler to piggyback on defn, and then use alter-var-root to shim the metadata management in, than it would have been to expand to the correct thing in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, attached patch #3 could be applied instead of #2 to resolve the issue in clojure.core instead of clojure.lang. The tests added in patch #1 pass either way.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="27286" author="amalloy" created="Sun, 13 Nov 2011 18:29:06 -0800">&lt;p&gt;I realized I can do this with a named private function instead of an anonymous function, reducing the amount of mess defmacro itself has to generate. Patch 4 is, I think, strictly better than Patch 3, if a Clojure implementation is preferred to one in Java.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="27331" author="chouser@n01se.net" created="Sun, 20 Nov 2011 20:43:45 -0800">&lt;p&gt;I prefer patch 0002 in Java over either 0003 or 0004. Patch 0002 keeps the knowledge of how to invoke macro fns (specifically the extra &amp;amp;form and &amp;amp;env args) in one place, macroexpand1 rather than duplicating that knowledge in core.clj as well. Note patch 0001 is just tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed default macroexpansion behavior is more useful than what we currently have, but there are two details I'd like to think about a bit more:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) In exchange for a more useful default, macro writers lose the ability to consume their &amp;amp;form metadata and have control over the resulting form metadata without the &amp;amp;form metadata overridding it. That is, macros are no longer in complete control of their output form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Rule (1) above has hardcoded exceptions for :line and :file, where &amp;amp;form metadata is unable to override the results returned by the macro.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-862] pmap level of parallelism inconsistent for chunked vs non-chunked input</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-862</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;The code of pmap creates futures for the set of map operations it needs to perform with (map #(future %) coll), then acts on that sequence in a fashion obviously intended to keep only #CPUs+2 unfinished futures realized at any given time.  It works exactly this way for non-chunked input seqs, but when pmap is passed a chunked seq, the seq of futures also becomes chunked.  This causes an arbitrary number of futures to be realized as the #CPUs+2 window and chunk-size window interact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The doc-string for pmap doesn't promise any particular level of parallelism, but I think the inconsistent parallelism for chunked vs non-chunked input comprises a bug.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-859] Built in dynamic vars don't have :dynamic metadata</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-859</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;I'm sure 'built in' is probably not the right term here, but I'm not sure what these are called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran into this issue earlier today while fixing a bug in clojail. Built in vars, particularly ones listed here without a source link: &lt;a href="http://clojure.github.com/clojure/clojure.core-api.html"&gt;http://clojure.github.com/clojure/clojure.core-api.html&lt;/a&gt;, do not have :dynamic metadata despite being dynamic. This includes &amp;#42;in&amp;#42;, &amp;#42;out&amp;#42;, and &amp;#42;err&amp;#42; among others. Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;user=&amp;gt; (meta #'*err*)
{:ns #&amp;lt;Namespace clojure.core&amp;gt;, :name *err*, :added &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"1.0"&lt;/span&gt;, :doc &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"A java.io.Writer object representing standard error &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; print operations.\n\n  Defaults to &lt;span class="code-object"&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;/err, wrapped in a PrintWriter"&lt;/span&gt;}
user=&amp;gt; (meta #'*in*)
{:ns #&amp;lt;Namespace clojure.core&amp;gt;, :name *in*, :added &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"1.0"&lt;/span&gt;, :doc &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"A java.io.Reader object representing standard input &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; read operations.\n\n  Defaults to &lt;span class="code-object"&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;/in, wrapped in a LineNumberingPushbackReader"&lt;/span&gt;}
user=&amp;gt; (meta #'*out*)
{:ns #&amp;lt;Namespace clojure.core&amp;gt;, :name *out*, :added &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"1.0"&lt;/span&gt;, :doc &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"A java.io.Writer object representing standard output &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; print operations.\n\n  Defaults to &lt;span class="code-object"&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;/out, wrapped in an OutputStreamWriter"&lt;/span&gt;, :tag java.io.Writer}
user=&amp;gt; (meta #'*ns*)
{:ns #&amp;lt;Namespace clojure.core&amp;gt;, :name *ns*, :added &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"1.0"&lt;/span&gt;, :doc &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"A clojure.lang.Namespace object representing the current namespace."&lt;/span&gt;, :tag clojure.lang.Namespace}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

                    <comment id="27072" author="bsmith.occs@gmail.com" created="Wed, 19 Oct 2011 10:03:11 -0700">&lt;p&gt;This recent discussion on the users list seems relevant: &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/d5efd00c699f73a7"&gt;Should intern obey :dynamic?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to boil down to this the information that a Var is dynamic (or not) is duplicated. Once as metadata with the key &lt;tt&gt;:dynamic&lt;/tt&gt;, and once as a boolean field on the Var class which implements Clojure's variables. This boolean can be obtained by calling the method &lt;tt&gt;isDynamic()&lt;/tt&gt; on the Var.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The confusion arises because apparently &lt;tt&gt;:dynamic&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;.isDynamic&lt;/tt&gt; can get out of sync with each other. &lt;tt&gt;.isDynamic&lt;/tt&gt; is the source of truth in this case.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="27073" author="bsmith.occs@gmail.com" created="Wed, 19 Oct 2011 10:18:22 -0700">&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Compiler$Parser.parse(...)&lt;/tt&gt; finds the &lt;tt&gt;:dynamic&lt;/tt&gt; entry left in the metadata of the symbol by &lt;tt&gt;LispReader&lt;/tt&gt; and passes this on when creating a new &lt;tt&gt;DefExpr&lt;/tt&gt;, which in turn, generates the code that will call &lt;tt&gt;setDynamic(...)&lt;/tt&gt; on the var when it is created at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, the &lt;tt&gt;:dynamic&lt;/tt&gt; entry is irrelevant once that has occurred. It seems to be implemented only as a way to communicate (by way of the reader) with the compiler. Once the compiler's gotten the message, it isn't needed anymore. Keeping it around seems to just cause confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dynamic vars created by the Java layer of Clojure core don't use the &lt;tt&gt;:dynamic&lt;/tt&gt; mechanism, they just &lt;tt&gt;setDynamic()&lt;/tt&gt; directly. That's why they don't have &lt;tt&gt;:dynamic&lt;/tt&gt; in their meta-data map. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="alternate" type="square"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Perhaps the compiler should elide &lt;tt&gt;:dynamic&lt;/tt&gt; from the metadata map available at runtime, since it has served its purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Perhaps Clojure should supply the function &lt;tt&gt;dynamic?&lt;/tt&gt;.
&lt;div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="preformattedContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;(defn dynamic? [^clojure.lang.Var v] (.isDynamic v))&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Or, perhaps one might consider, for 1.4, replacing &lt;tt&gt;:dynamic&lt;/tt&gt; altogether and just enforcing the established naming convention: &lt;tt&gt;&amp;#42;earmuffs&amp;#42;&lt;/tt&gt; are dynamic, &lt;tt&gt;everything-else&lt;/tt&gt; isn't. (The compile warns about violations of this convention in 1.3.)&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="27839" author="jafingerhut" created="Fri, 24 Feb 2012 09:39:08 -0800">&lt;p&gt;I recently noticed several lines like this one in core.clj.  Depending upon how many symbols are like this, perhaps this method could be used to add :dynamic metadata to symbols in core, along with a unit test to verify that all symbols in core have :dynamic if and only if .isDynamic returns true?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;(alter-meta! #'&lt;b&gt;agent&lt;/b&gt; assoc :added "1.0")&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-858</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Original post: &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/clojure/kc99LcUK8Tk/discussion"&gt;https://groups.google.com/d/topic/clojure/kc99LcUK8Tk/discussion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This patch removes the milliseconds from inner class TVal in LockingTransaction.java and Ref.java.  Using a little test suite&lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;1&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; a increase of performance by up to 25% could be measured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If necessary I can recreate the patch against current MASTER.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Provides a test to reproduce this issue, as well as a test that shows that the workaround of using ^"[J" as type hint works correctly.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="26995" author="bsmith.occs@gmail.com" created="Sun, 16 Oct 2011 00:23:54 -0700">&lt;p&gt;OK, I see the problem here: &lt;tt&gt;longs&lt;/tt&gt; plays two roles in Clojure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;As an unqualified symbol, it's taken to mean &lt;tt&gt;long[].class&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;clojure.core/longs&lt;/tt&gt; is a definline function which calls &lt;tt&gt;clojure.lang.Numbers.longs(...)&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The example in the issue description is expecting the first interpretation, but what we're actually getting is the second interpretation, i.e. the :tag is not a symbol &lt;tt&gt;longs&lt;/tt&gt;, but rather a function (an instance of the class &lt;tt&gt;clojure.core$longs&lt;/tt&gt;, to be precise).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it's as if we'd written this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="preformattedContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;(def ^{:tag clojure.core/longs} la (long-array 0))
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When really, we meant this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="preformattedContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;(def ^{:tag 'longs} la (long-array 0))
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the behavior described by this issue is confusing, it looks to me like it's &lt;em&gt;not a bug&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

I should be calling &lt;tt&gt;invokePrim(Ljava/lang/Object;J)J;&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;XXX this is where I got myself confused. The &lt;tt&gt;invokePrim&lt;/tt&gt; overload it's trying to invoke is the &lt;b&gt;correct&lt;/b&gt; one. But, that apparently is no the one that's being generated. Sorry for the noise.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;&lt;tt&gt;HostExpr.Parse.parse()&lt;/tt&gt; loses track of the return type, in the final else branch where method calls are handled.  This is because &lt;tt&gt;tagOf(form)&lt;/tt&gt;, where form is something like: &lt;tt&gt;(. foo invokePrim 1)&lt;/tt&gt; returns nil. (The form itself doesn't have a &lt;tt&gt;:tag&lt;/tt&gt;, but I believe &lt;tt&gt;foo&lt;/tt&gt; does, though that's the name of the appropriate &lt;tt&gt;invokePrim&lt;/tt&gt; interface (i.e. &lt;tt&gt;IFn$OLL&lt;/tt&gt;).&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;&lt;tt&gt;new InstanceMethodExpr(...)&lt;/tt&gt; then gets constructed with &lt;tt&gt;tag==null&lt;/tt&gt;, at which point we've already lost sine InstanceMethodExpr can't correctly consider overloading on the result type if it doesn't know what it is.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;It's not yet clear to me how I can get InstanceMethodExpr to consider the return type, if it knew it...&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two things going on here. I'm not sure which is the error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like the return type of the generated invokePrim method is too specific. It's generated as returning String, though the IFn$LO interface specifies returning Object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The caller attempts to call invokePrim returning Object, which is what the interface IFn$LO specifies, but this doesn't work because methodSL doesn't actually implement that method. Instead it implements an overload returning String.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;methodSL.invokePrim is declared as &lt;tt&gt;(long)-&amp;gt;String&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;methodSL.invoke does invokeinterface with the correct return type WRT methodSL, but the wrong return type WRT the IFn$LO interface.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;callSL.invoke does invokeinterface with the wrong return type WRT methodSL, but the correct return type WRT IFn$LO. (This is the failure we observe in the clj-850 unit test.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="preformattedContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;(defn methodSL  ^String [^long i] (str i))

                    <comment id="27016" author="bsmith.occs@gmail.com" created="Mon, 17 Oct 2011 23:40:59 -0700">&lt;p&gt;Given &lt;tt&gt;P&lt;/tt&gt; is some primitive type, &lt;tt&gt;O&lt;/tt&gt; is type Object, and &lt;tt&gt;R&lt;/tt&gt; some subclass of Object: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Clojure generates a &lt;tt&gt;R invokePrim(P x)&lt;/tt&gt;, it also generates a &lt;tt&gt;Object invoke(Object x)&lt;/tt&gt;, which delegates to &lt;tt&gt;R invokePrim(P x)&lt;/tt&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;R invokePrim(P x)&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;em&gt;overloads&lt;/em&gt;, but does not &lt;em&gt;override&lt;/em&gt; the method of the corresponding &lt;tt&gt;Fn$PO&lt;/tt&gt; interface. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Clojure were to generate an additional &lt;tt&gt;O invokePrim(P x)&lt;/tt&gt; which delegates to &lt;tt&gt;R invokePrim(P x)&lt;/tt&gt;, it would satisfy the requirements of the &lt;tt&gt;Fn$PO&lt;/tt&gt; interface, and should fix this issue.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;I consider this patch to be pretty hackish and hope that there's a cleaner way of addressing &lt;a href="http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-850" title="Hinting the arg vector of a primitive-taking fn with a non-primitive type results in AbstractMethodError when invoked"&gt;CLJ-850&lt;/a&gt;. This is the first time I've tried to understand (much less change) the Clojure compiler, so don't expect genius.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="27020" author="bsmith.occs@gmail.com" created="Wed, 19 Oct 2011 03:06:03 -0700">&lt;p&gt;The patch lies slightly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clojure needs to generate an additional &lt;tt&gt;O invokePrim(P x)&lt;/tt&gt; method to&lt;br/&gt;
satisfy the interface. This also delegates to &lt;tt&gt;R invokePrim(P x)&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that what I'm actually doing is generating a &lt;tt&gt;R invokePrim(P x)&lt;/tt&gt; which is a copy of &lt;tt&gt;O invokePrim(P x)&lt;/tt&gt;, instead of delgating to &lt;tt&gt;O invokePrim(P x)&lt;/tt&gt;. This works, but the resulting class file would be smaller if the patch actually did what it says it does.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="27882" author="jafingerhut" created="Mon, 27 Feb 2012 22:49:32 -0800">&lt;p&gt;clj-850-type-hinted-fn-abstractmethoderror-patch2.txt is identical to Ben's two patches combined into one, with the small modification that the new tests are added to metadata.clj instead of creating a new test file.  The patch applies cleanly to latest master as of Feb 27, 2012.  One of the new tests does fail without the change to the compiler, and succeeds with it.  I can't vouch for the correctness of the change myself, not knowing enough about the compiler internals to judge.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="27999" author="jafingerhut" created="Fri, 23 Mar 2012 17:50:25 -0700">&lt;p&gt;Same comments as made on Feb 27, 2012, except the patch clj-850-type-hinted-fn-abstractmethoderror-patch3.txt applies cleanly to latest master as of Mar 23, 2012.  Updated because previous patch (now removed) no longer applied cleanly.  git patches often fail to apply if context lines near changes are modified.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="28135" author="richhickey" created="Fri, 13 Apr 2012 07:35:51 -0700">&lt;p&gt;We don't support sigs taking prims and returning anything other than prim or Object. Overloading on return value only is a bad idea (and forbidden in Java). The return type of the generated method should be Object, and the String return hint should be used only as a hint.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;It will be useful for diagnostic log messages. Using exception stack traces has poor runtime performance and the line number should be available to the compiler at minimal cost.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;(:a (bean {} nil)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works, but it's inconvenient and adds complexity to the handling of bean maps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normal maps of course already return nil as the default value for a missing key.  The current bean proxy does the contains? check on the key only if there's a default value.  The patch uses the same contains? check for the single-arg version of valAt.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was looking through the implementation of clojure.pprint.* and found that it still uses the old-style metadata to mark vars as private - ^{:private true} instead of ^:private.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have migrated the metadata to the new style in the attached trivial patch, which can be used in case this is deemed to be an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FWIW, there are some other namespaces which use the old-style metadata as well; I am willing to fix those as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                        <description>&lt;p&gt;When looking at (log) output from tests written with clojure.test, I would like to be able to identify the output associated with each test. A mechanism to expose the current test var within an :each fixture would enable this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One mechanism might be to bind a &lt;b&gt;test-var&lt;/b&gt; var with the current test var before calling the each-fixture-fn in clojure.test/test-all-vars.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the &lt;tt&gt;:each&lt;/tt&gt; fixture functions should be called in &lt;tt&gt;test-var&lt;/tt&gt; rather than in test-all-vars. (The namespace of a Var is available in its metadata.) But then we have to call &lt;tt&gt;join-fixtures&lt;/tt&gt; inside &lt;tt&gt;test-var&lt;/tt&gt; every time.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;This makes &lt;tt&gt;&amp;#42;testing-vars&amp;#42;&lt;/tt&gt; visible to &lt;tt&gt;:each&lt;/tt&gt; fixture functions, which seems intuitively more correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BUT it slightly changes the behavior of &lt;tt&gt;test-var&lt;/tt&gt;, which I'm less happy about.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;I've attached a new doc string patch in response to Andy Fingerhut's request posted here: &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/clojure-dev/i7H82fJYL-U"&gt;https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/clojure-dev/i7H82fJYL-U&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andy's request stated "Attached patch seems to have spelling mistakes, and perhaps could be worded more clearly."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope my new patch is an improvement upon what was there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This patch supersedes '0001-Clarify-docstring-for-defmulti.patch' from 14/Sep/11.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-828] clojure.core/bases returns a cons when passed a class and a Java array when passed an interface</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-828</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;clojure.core/bases returns a clojure.lang.Cons when called with a class as parameter, but a Java array ( [Ljava.lang.Class; &amp;#41; when called with an interface. Both should return values of the same type, which I guess should be a seq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Showing the problem at the REPL:&lt;br/&gt;
user=&amp;gt; (bases java.util.List)&lt;br/&gt;
#&amp;lt;Class[] [Ljava.lang.Class;@315b0333&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;
user=&amp;gt; (bases java.util.ArrayList)&lt;br/&gt;
(java.util.AbstractList java.util.List java.util.RandomAccess&lt;br/&gt;
java.lang.Cloneable java.io.Serializable) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have attached a patch which calls the seq function on the else part of clojure.core/bases. Also updated the clojure.test-clojure.java-interop/test-bases test. However these test do not currently seem to run as part of the maven build. I have however run the test manually and verified that it works.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The patch writer Alf is not on the list of people who have signed a CA.  If he isn't in the process of doing so, what should be done with the patch?  If I described the behavior to a committer without showing them the patch, they would likely come up with a similar one-line fix. &lt;img class="emoticon" src="http://dev.clojure.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="27867" author="stoyle" created="Fri, 24 Feb 2012 23:09:33 -0800">&lt;p&gt;I was not aware that contributors had to sign the CA to get a patch in when I wrote this, so my apologies for adding the patch. I just wanted to make the contribution an "easy add". I guess you guys would have figured out a similar fix really easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not in the process of signing the CA. I would not have any problems signing it, but then I guess for such a small contribution it would be too much of a hassle. And besides, I don't think this small contribution makes me a worthy contributor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would certainly not mind you guys fixing this in anyway you can, with or without my patch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;br/&gt;
Alf&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;I agree it might be a bit of a hassle to sign a CA just for this fix.  Legally, a Clojure contributor is one whether anyone considers them "worthy" or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll figure something out.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-827] unsigned-bit-shift-right</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-827</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Add a clojure equivalent of &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple version of this is implemented here (&lt;a href="https://github.com/joegallo/clojure/tree/unsigned-bit-shift-right"&gt;https://github.com/joegallo/clojure/tree/unsigned-bit-shift-right&lt;/a&gt;), and just follows the example set by shift-right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside of this implementation is that it treats all integer types as longs, and shifts them accordingly, which yields different results than you would get in java.  A previous version of this did not have the same problem, when BitOps was its own thing.  I'm not sure if this limitation is acceptable and appropriate, or needs to be worked around (my inclination is the latter).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <comment id="27276" author="joegallo" created="Fri, 11 Nov 2011 10:58:31 -0800">&lt;p&gt;I just realized (with the asssistance of Paul Stadig) that just doing only longs is probably sufficient, as you can get the integer version if you really want it: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; (int (bit-and Integer/MAX_VALUE (unsigned-bit-shift-right -5 1)))&lt;br/&gt;
2147483645 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, that's less efficient than just doing it directly with java, but it's enough that I think my concern from the previous comment is addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>[CLJ-825] Protocol implementation inconsistencies </title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-825</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;There seems to be some inconsistencies when implementing protocols that have multi arity functions depending on how the protocol is implemented. I have attached a clj file illustrating this. The short version is that multi arity must be defined as such w/ defrecord:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(defrecord Zomg []&lt;br/&gt;
  SomeProto&lt;br/&gt;
  (hello &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;_&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; 1)&lt;br/&gt;
  (hello &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;_ _&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; 1))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as such with extend-type&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(extend-type Object&lt;br/&gt;
  SomeProto&lt;br/&gt;
  (hello&lt;br/&gt;
    (&lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;_&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; 1)&lt;br/&gt;
    (&lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;_ _&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; 1)))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have only tested defrecord &amp;amp; extend-type. I am unsure how it works with deftype and extend-protocol.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-823] Piping seque into seque can deadlock</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-823</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if this is a supported scenario, but the following deadlocks in Clojure 1.3:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;(let [xs (seque (range 150000))&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;ys (seque (filter odd? xs))]&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;(apply + ys))&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I understand it, the problem is that ys' fill takes place on an agent thread, so when it calls xs' drain, the &lt;tt&gt;(send-off agt fill)&lt;/tt&gt; does not immediately trigger xs' fill, but is instead put on the nested list to be performed when ys' agent returns. Unfortunately, ys' fill will eventually block trying to take from xs, and so it never returns and the pending send-offs are never sent. Wrapping the send-off in drain to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;(future (send-off agt fill))&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is a simple (probably not optimal) way to fix the deadlock.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-821] should reify merge rather than replace on repeated specs? </title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-821</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;reify, deftype, and the like fail silently if you specify a class twice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(macroexpand '(reify Map (size &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;this&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; 0), &lt;br/&gt;
                     Counted (count &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;this&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; 0), &lt;br/&gt;
                     Map (keySet &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;this&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; nil)))&lt;br/&gt;
;=&amp;gt; (reify* &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;Counted Map&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; (count &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;this&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; 0) (keySet &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;this&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; nil))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The later Map section entirely supersedes the former, which I discovered when I wrote a macro that injects some automated method bodies into a reify for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've attached a fix to make the above expand to the expected &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;for me, anyway&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; output.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <comment id="26650" author="stu" created="Mon, 25 Jul 2011 15:01:35 -0700">&lt;p&gt;In Clojure, it is generally the case that redefining something &lt;b&gt;replaces&lt;/b&gt; the original, as opposed to augmenting it by merging the old and the new. This makes it easy to reason locally about how code works. One could argue that the following snippet has the same kind of issue you describe:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;(defn foo [a] 1)
(defn foo [a b] 1)
(foo 1) ; is it a bug that the first arity is gone?&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wonder whether the current behavior might be a convenience for some macros. (Clearly it wasn't for yours!) I am changing the type and title of the ticket to better reflect the nature of the request and see what the BDFL says. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="26666" author="richhickey" created="Fri, 29 Jul 2011 05:32:37 -0700">&lt;p&gt;Everything in this ticket needs to be said with more precision. I don't know what exactly the problem is nor what the proposed solution is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to note is that it is necessary to accept definitions under base interfaces, so the class areas are not strict, nor expected to be complete.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="26714" author="amalloy" created="Tue, 9 Aug 2011 12:16:53 -0700">&lt;p&gt;Stuart: The two foo forms you give are entirely separate, and to unify the two behaviors you would have to group them together. It's not at all unreasonable to suppose the user wants to define foo once, fiddle with it, and then redefine it - clojure.core does similar stuff with let, reduce, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As written, deftype/reify have a somewhat similar "look" - because there is nothing physically grouping the declaration of Map with its functions, it's not clear what should happen when a heading like Map is given twice, and it's not specified in the docs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the difference is that in the reify case, the two are in the &lt;em&gt;same top-level form&lt;/em&gt;, so the compiler can detect that you're trying to do something "weird", so a silent redefinition (reasonable for your defn example) is surprising. There are a number of solutions that would reduce this surprise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Permit or require reify to group things, as in (reify (Comparable (compare &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;this other&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; 1))). Then the explicit grouping of Comparable with its methods serves two purposes: it implies that other definitions for Comparable should be included in that grouping; and it makes it easier to &lt;b&gt;do&lt;/b&gt; that, because you can just iterate over forms until you find Comparable, and then insert another definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Throw an exception if an interface is specified twice. This is not ideal because it can be a lot of work for the user to group things together themselves, while it's easy for deftype to do given the grouping it's already doing. However, it would avoid the confusion and surprise, by saying "that's not allowed" rather than leaving the user guessing what's gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Interpret my original example code as an attempt to open the Map interface, add implementations, and then later add some more implementations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would have liked reify to implement (1) to begin with, but at this point I don't think the syntax is backwards-compatible, so it doesn't seem like a good idea. I suppose either (2) or (3) is fine, and they both seem like an improvement over the current confusing behavior. Of course, I prefer (3), but I can understand a desire to make reify reject syntax that is not immediately obvious in intent rather than interpreting it as what I think is the most useful intent.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-820</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Using the clojure git head as of 2011-07-14 (commit f704853751d02faf72bd53be599ee0be6c1da63e), int coercion doesn't work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;user&amp;gt; (class (int 1))&lt;br/&gt;
java.lang.Long&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;byte, short, double, and float coercion work fine, though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;user&amp;gt; (class (byte 1))&lt;br/&gt;
java.lang.Byte&lt;br/&gt;
user&amp;gt; (class (short 1))&lt;br/&gt;
java.lang.Short&lt;br/&gt;
user&amp;gt; (class (double 1))&lt;br/&gt;
java.lang.Double&lt;br/&gt;
user&amp;gt; (class (float 1))&lt;br/&gt;
java.lang.Float&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also creating integers directly works fine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;user&amp;gt; (class (Integer. "100"))&lt;br/&gt;
java.lang.Integer&lt;br/&gt;
user&amp;gt; (class (Integer/valueOf 1))&lt;br/&gt;
java.lang.Integer&lt;br/&gt;
user&amp;gt; (class (Integer. 100))&lt;br/&gt;
java.lang.Integer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably related to &lt;a href="http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-439" title="Automatic type translation from Integer to Long"&gt;&lt;del&gt;CLJ-439&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;all long-or-smaller integers are boxed as Long&lt;br/&gt;
You can't use primitive coercions to force specific box types&lt;br/&gt;
Your code was broken if you were relying on that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, apparently (int) has the correct behavior. It's byte and short which should be also boxed into Longs&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

I mean, &lt;a href="http://clojure.org/java_interop#Java"&gt;http://clojure.org/java_interop#Java&lt;/a&gt; Interop-Coercions states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  "At times it is necessary to have a value of a particular primitive type. These coercion functions yield a value of the indicated type as long as such a coercion is possible: bigdec bigint boolean byte char double float int long num short"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's exactly my use case which is not supported anymore.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="26576" author="paraseba" created="Fri, 15 Jul 2011 21:09:37 -0700">&lt;p&gt;(int) (char) etc. are not intended to return boxed types, they always return primitive types. If you want boxed types you can use (num). When you do (class (int 42)) you are casting the long 42 to a int and then boxing it into a Long to get its class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For short and byte, I don't know, I think there is a bug, (class (short 42)) should be Short.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="26577" author="tsdh" created="Sat, 16 Jul 2011 05:13:07 -0700">&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;(int) (char) etc. are not intended to return boxed types, they always return primitive types.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you, Sebastián, that made it clear and unveiled the problem at my side.  When I did&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  &lt;tt&gt;(set-value! foo :position (int 17))&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got the exception "java.lang.Long cannot be cast to java.lang.Integer".  set-value! is a protocol function extended on the java types of the java library I'm interacting with.  Eventually, it'll call &lt;tt&gt;(doto foo (.setAttribute "position" (mutable &amp;lt;providedVal&amp;gt;))&lt;/tt&gt;, where mutable is yet another protocol function that converts clojure collections to the libraries counterparts and does nothing for primitive types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, although (int 17) returns an unboxed int, these two indirections box it into a Long again and the java setter is called with that leading to the error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  &lt;tt&gt;(set-value! foo :position (Integer/intValue 17))&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;circumvents the issue, because here you directly get an int boxed as Integer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;If you want boxed types you can use (num).&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I want a boxed value of a certain type, like Integer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;For short and byte, I don't know, I think there is a bug, (class (short 42)) should be Short.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should or should not?  Currently, for all primitive types &amp;lt;primType&amp;gt;, the call &lt;tt&gt;(class (&amp;lt;primType&amp;gt; &amp;lt;val&amp;gt;))&lt;/tt&gt; returns the wrapper class corresponding to &amp;lt;primType&amp;gt; with the exception of int where you get a Long instead of an Integer.  That's totally surprising and caused me to file this bug report.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-809] fn's created using defn should not lexical shadow the var that holds them</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-809</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;currently (defn foo &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;x&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; (foo x)) expands to something like (def foo&lt;br/&gt;
(fn foo &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;x&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; (foo x))) so the fn is bound to foo lexically in the scope&lt;br/&gt;
of the fn body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;because of this lexical shadowing self calls to fns defined with defn&lt;br/&gt;
do not incur the overhead of var dereferencing, I assume this is the&lt;br/&gt;
reason it was added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the lexical shadowing also breaks memoization if you create the&lt;br/&gt;
memoized functions via (alter-var-root #'foo memoize) and several&lt;br/&gt;
macros here and there emit code in this style, since reusing defn is&lt;br/&gt;
the easiest way to get all the good juicy metadata bits like arglists,&lt;br/&gt;
etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.3 has changes to eliminate some of the cost of going through the var.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;since going through the var is much cheaper now it would be nice to &lt;br/&gt;
eliminate the lexical shadowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/1023816"&gt;https://gist.github.com/1023816&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure how to properly hint the var in the var-prim version to get truly comparable results.  In any case, this use case should definitely be kept in mind. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>

A sufficiently smart compiler could optimize the calls out entirely, which would not tell us much about the runtime of foo.  &lt;/p&gt;</comment>

These simulated tests aren't necessarily indicative. Naive fib is an ok test once you have a patch. And yes, more things might break - needs careful assessment.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Per Rich in &lt;a href="http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-799" title="ArrayMaps print-dup with read-eval"&gt;&lt;del&gt;CLJ-799&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: "The point of print-dup is type preservation"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="preformattedContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;user=&amp;gt; (hash-map :k :v)
{:k :v}

clojure.lang.PersistentArrayMap
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cause is due to &lt;tt&gt;RT.map&lt;/tt&gt; conditionally creating an array-map if the size is within the &lt;tt&gt;PersistentArrayMap.HASHTABLE_THRESHOLD&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Atom and the other reference types do not have interfaces and are marked final.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use cases for interfaces for the reference types include database wrappers. CouchDB behaves exactly like compare-and-set! and is shared, synchronous, independent state, so it makes sense to use the Atom interface to update a CouchDB document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I talked to Rich about this, and he said "patch welcome for IAtom", complete conversation: &lt;a href="http://clojure-log.n01se.net/date/2010-12-29.html#10:04c"&gt;http://clojure-log.n01se.net/date/2010-12-29.html#10:04c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Maybe I ICompareAndSwap. Atoms and couchdb are different so making them appear the same is a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://clojure.org/state"&gt;http://clojure.org/state&lt;/a&gt; one of the distinctions between agents and actors raised in the section titled "Message Passing and Actors" is local vs. distributed and the same distinction can be made between couchdb (regardless of compare and swap) and atoms&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-792] Refactor method resolution code out of Compiler and into Reflector</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-792</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Code for obtaining method/constructor instances is duplicated across the Compiler&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Code for resolving a preferred overloaded method lives in the Compiler&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By consolidating the duplicated code, moving the reflection-related parts into Reflector, and providing a straightforward API, it should be easier to read and understand the method resolution process.  Further, improvements to (e.g., &lt;a href="http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-445" title="Method/Constructor resolution does not factor in widening conversion of primitive args"&gt;CLJ-445&lt;/a&gt;) the mechanism for reflecting on class members can largely be isolated from the Compiler.  And the few points of coordination (e.g., Compiler emitting same arg and return types as Reflector does when invoking) can be clearly identified and documented.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It compiles, but does not pass ant test.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-790] Primitive type hints on function names should print error message</title>

                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Functions returning primitives are hinted with metadata on the argument list, not on the function name.  Using a primitive type hint on a function name should print an error message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, misplaced primitive hints are read without error.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The current implementation of TransientVector depends on implementation details of PersistentVector, so it is not a trivial fix. The simplest fix might be to implement IEditableCollection.asTransient in SubVector by creating a new PersistentVector, but I do not know the performance implications.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-783] clojure.inspector/inspect-tree doesn't work on sets --patch in the description by Jason Wolfe</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-783</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;As reported by Jason Wolfe on March 19, 2009 in the clojure group:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;clojure.inspector/inspect-tree doesn't work on sets; patch attached&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/97bcad115fcfaf5a/95e61c423c61cfa8?lnk=gst&amp;amp;q=inspector+set#95e61c423c61cfa8"&gt;http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/97bcad115fcfaf5a/95e61c423c61cfa8?lnk=gst&amp;amp;q=inspector+set#95e61c423c61cfa8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was debugging with inspect-tree and noticed that it errors when it &lt;br/&gt;
encounters a set (it thinks it's not atomic, but then nth produces an &lt;br/&gt;
UnsupportedOperationException). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a small patch (below) that makes inspect-tree work on &lt;br/&gt;
java.util.Sets, and also anything else that implements &lt;br/&gt;
clojure.lang.Seqable.  If this is of interest, please let me know and &lt;br/&gt;
I can create an issue. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Cheers, &lt;br/&gt;
Jason &lt;/p&gt;

            <title>[CLJ-776] seque broken for some BlockingQueues</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-776</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;clojure.core/seque takes an optional argument that can be the initial capacity for a LinkedBlockingQueue or an instance of the BlockingQueue interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PriorityBlockingQueue is such a class, but fails to work because seque makes a few assumptions about BlockingQueues that are not true for all BlockingQueues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;user=&amp;gt; (def s (seque (java.util.concurrent.PriorityBlockingQueue. 100) (shuffle (range 100))))&lt;br/&gt;
#'user/s&lt;br/&gt;
user=&amp;gt; s&lt;br/&gt;
java.lang.NullPointerException&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;user=&amp;gt; (seque (java.util.concurrent.SynchronousQueue.) (shuffle (range 100)))&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;lt;never finishes&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;user=&amp;gt; (seque (java.util.concurrent.ArrayBlockingQueue. 10) (shuffle (range 100)))&lt;br/&gt;

Similarly on Mac OS X 10.6.8 with Java 1.6.0_29 and Maven 3.0.3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may have been fixed already in 1.3.0, but it would be good for Steven to confirm.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;$ uname -a&lt;br/&gt;
Linux ubuntu 2.6.38-13-generic #57-Ubuntu SMP Mon Mar 5 18:10:14 UTC 2012 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux&lt;br/&gt;
$ java -version&lt;br/&gt;
java version "1.7.0_02"&lt;br/&gt;
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_02-b13)&lt;br/&gt;
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 22.0-b10, mixed mode)&lt;br/&gt;
$ ant -version&lt;br/&gt;
Apache Ant version 1.8.1 compiled on October 13 2010&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With latest Clojure master as of Apr 11 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: I saw this problem when I had tar'ed a .tar.gz file of the Clojure source code on one machine with a current date, then untar'ed it on a machine with its clock set a few days earlier.  Thus there were many warnings during compilation about file dates being in the future.  This may have had something to do with the failures, because when I updated the system's time, the compile and tests passed.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-768] cl-format bug in ~f formatting</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-768</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Carlos Ungil reports a bug in cl-format as follows (&lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/bb235ff4464aed78#):"&gt;http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/bb235ff4464aed78#):&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know if there is a better way to file bug reports (if there is one,&lt;br/&gt;
it's not easy to find).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(use 'clojure.pprint)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(let &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;x 111.11111&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
  (doseq [fmt &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;&amp;quot;~3f~%&amp;quot; &amp;quot;~4f~%&amp;quot; &amp;quot;~5f~%&amp;quot; &amp;quot;~6f~%&amp;quot;&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;br/&gt;
    (cl-format true fmt x)))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;;; 111.11111&lt;br/&gt;
;; 111.11111&lt;br/&gt;
;; 111.1&lt;br/&gt;
;; 111.11&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is clearly a problem in the first two cases, too many digits are being&lt;br/&gt;
printed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reference, this is what common lisp does:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(let ((x 111.11111))&lt;br/&gt;
  (loop for fmt  in '("&lt;sub&gt;3f&lt;/sub&gt;%" "&lt;sub&gt;4f&lt;/sub&gt;%" "&lt;sub&gt;5f&lt;/sub&gt;%" "&lt;sub&gt;6f&lt;/sub&gt;%")&lt;br/&gt;
do (format t fmt x)))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;;; 111.&lt;br/&gt;
;; 111.&lt;br/&gt;
;; 111.1&lt;br/&gt;
;; 111.11&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carlos &lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <comment id="27711" author="jafingerhut" created="Mon, 13 Feb 2012 19:49:54 -0800">&lt;p&gt;Attached patch assumes that &lt;a href="http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-881" title="Problem with the &amp;quot;cl-format&amp;quot; function from the clojure.pprint"&gt;CLJ-881&lt;/a&gt; patch has been applied.  It might apply cleanly without &lt;a href="http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-881" title="Problem with the &amp;quot;cl-format&amp;quot; function from the clojure.pprint"&gt;CLJ-881&lt;/a&gt; patch being applied first &amp;#8211; I haven't checked.  Fixes the issue originally reported, and several other problems found with cl-format's ~f directive.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="27739" author="tomfaulhaber" created="Fri, 17 Feb 2012 07:26:21 -0800">&lt;p&gt;I've reviewed the patch and it looks good to me. Thanks, Andy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To clojure/core: please go ahead and accept this patch.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="27742" author="jafingerhut" created="Fri, 17 Feb 2012 11:33:52 -0800">&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the review, Tom.  If you have the time, &lt;a href="http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-881" title="Problem with the &amp;quot;cl-format&amp;quot; function from the clojure.pprint"&gt;CLJ-881&lt;/a&gt; is shorter, and fixes a different bug.  I do know that if you apply the &lt;a href="http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-881" title="Problem with the &amp;quot;cl-format&amp;quot; function from the clojure.pprint"&gt;CLJ-881&lt;/a&gt; recommended patch, and then this one, everything works fine.  If it is helpful, I can try out this one independently, but they are both bugs in the ~f format of cl-format, the other one causing Clojure to throw an exception for some combinations of ~f directives and numerical values.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="27810" author="jafingerhut" created="Thu, 23 Feb 2012 01:30:26 -0800">&lt;p&gt;clj-768-without-clj-881-patched-first.txt is the same as the one that Tom reviewed, except it applies cleanly to master as of Feb 23, 2012 without having to first apply the patch for &lt;a href="http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-881" title="Problem with the &amp;quot;cl-format&amp;quot; function from the clojure.pprint"&gt;CLJ-881&lt;/a&gt;.  This bug and the patch are really independent of &lt;a href="http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-881" title="Problem with the &amp;quot;cl-format&amp;quot; function from the clojure.pprint"&gt;CLJ-881&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-766</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="preformattedContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;base64v3a=&amp;gt; (into-array Byte/TYPE [1 2 3 4])
#&amp;lt;byte[] [B@5ee04fd&amp;gt;
base64v3a=&amp;gt; (byte-array [1 2 3 4])
ClassCastException java.lang.Long cannot be cast to java.lang.Byte
  clojure.lang.Numbers.byte_array (Numbers.java:1418)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While into-array (via RT.seqToTypedArray) casts each element prior to inserting into the array, byte-array (via Numbers.byte_array) does an unchecked cast to Byte.&lt;/p&gt;

                        <description>&lt;p&gt;(partition n seq) and (partition-all n seq) are implemented by taking n and dropping n from seq.  When n=0 this becomes an infinite sequence of empty sequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While conceptionally this makes sense, I think practically it may surprise people, and perhaps it should return an empty sequence or a sequence of a single empty sequence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-763] Do not use hash-map constructor in destructuring to avoid multiple key check.</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-763</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;What I did:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;(defn number-to-string
  [&amp;amp; {fmt :format locale :locale :or {locale (Locale/getDefault)}}]
  (fn [v]
    (&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;/format locale fmt (to-array [v]))))

(defn &lt;span class="code-object"&gt;double&lt;/span&gt;-to-string
  [&amp;amp; options]
  (apply number-to-string :format &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"%f"&lt;/span&gt; options))

(def us-number (&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;double&lt;/span&gt;-to-string :locale Locale/US))
(def legacy-number (&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;double&lt;/span&gt;-to-string :format &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"% 3.2f"&lt;/span&gt;))

(us-number 3.14159)
(legacy-number 3.14159)&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I expected:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;&lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"3.14159"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"  3,14"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I got:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Duplicate key: :format&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;tt&gt;into&lt;/tt&gt; or a combination of &lt;tt&gt;reduce&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;assoc&lt;/tt&gt; instead of &lt;tt&gt;hash-map&lt;/tt&gt; would allow this without breaking things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is a desired modification, I can provide a patch. (CA is filed.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-761</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Originally reported by &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/clojure/0JYeIgzAwsQ/discussion"&gt;Carson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;print-dup&lt;/tt&gt; on any collection type generates code to call the &lt;tt&gt;create&lt;/tt&gt; method of the collection's class.  &lt;tt&gt;APersistentVector$SubVector&lt;/tt&gt; has no &lt;tt&gt;create&lt;/tt&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example with Clojure at commit ecae8ff08a298777c365a261001adfe9bfa4d83c :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;Clojure 1.3.0-master-SNAPSHOT
user=&amp;gt; (read-string (binding [*print-dup* &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;] (pr-str (subvec [1 2 3] 1))))
IllegalArgumentException No matching method found: create  clojure.lang.Reflector.invokeMatchingMethod (Reflector.java:50)&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-760</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;If I create a deftype that refers to itself in a protocol extension like below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="preformattedContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;(ns type-test)

(defprotocol Foo
  (isa-foo [x]))

(deftype TypeTest []
  Foo
  (isa-foo [x]
           (instance? TypeTest x)))
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And use that code via another namespace:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="preformattedContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;(ns test-type-user
  (:use [type-test :only (isa-foo)])
  (:import [type-test TypeTest]))

(isa-foo (TypeTest.))
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I try to AOT compile the test-type-user namespace with Clojure 1.2.0, I get &lt;em&gt;java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: compile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;stub/type-test/TypeTest (test_type_user.clj:5)&lt;/em&gt;.  Full stack trace attached.  Running the same code on 1.2.1 and 1.3.0-alpha6 yielded the same exception with a slightly different error message (stacktrace for 1.2.1 is also in the attached file).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This came up in a test at Revelytix.  We worked around this issue by not using &lt;em&gt;instance?&lt;/em&gt; and instead comparing based on class name.  Another workaround is to define the deftype and the extension separately (using extend-type or something similar).  This problem also doesn't occur if the usage of the deftype and the definition of it are in the same namespace (i.e. if &lt;em&gt;type-test&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;test-type-user&lt;/em&gt; were in the same file).&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>[CLJ-757] Empty transient maps/sets return wrong value for .contains</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-757</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;As explained in &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/496ffc7fb9058699/6e9d8152b6fd6365?show_docid=6e9d8152b6fd6365"&gt;http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/496ffc7fb9058699/6e9d8152b6fd6365?show_docid=6e9d8152b6fd6365&lt;/a&gt;, (.contains (transient #{}) :some-key) returns true instead of false. (contains? #{} :some-key) works properly, but the plain .contains method does not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue is in TransientHashMap.doValAt(key, notFound), and the attached patch is a simple fix with test.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-753</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/clojure/wDO1u7wRmDQ/discussion"&gt;Originally reported by Takahiro Hozumi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a function as the "replacement" argument, clojure.string/replace-first returns nil if there is no match, instead of returning the original string unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;user=&amp;gt; (use 'clojure.string)
nil
user=&amp;gt; (replace-first &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"abcdef"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"ghi"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"jkl"&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"abcdef"&lt;/span&gt;
user=&amp;gt; (replace-first &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"abcdef"&lt;/span&gt; #&lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"ghi"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"jkl"&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"abcdef"&lt;/span&gt;
user=&amp;gt; (replace-first &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"abcdef"&lt;/span&gt; #&lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"ghi"&lt;/span&gt; (fn [a] &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"jkl"&lt;/span&gt;))
nil&lt;/pre&gt;

                    <comment id="27360" author="jafingerhut" created="Mon, 28 Nov 2011 15:09:40 -0800">&lt;p&gt;I've tested Chris's clojure-string-with-no-match-returns-original-2.patch against latest github Clojure as of this morning, and the tests pass.  Cool that he found a straightforward performance improvement for the no match case.  The code appears correct.  I also verified that for the reason Chris mentions, StringBuilder will not work as a replacement for StringBuffer.  At least there will never be any contention on the locks implementing the StringBuffer synchronization the way they are used here.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-750] clojure.lang.MapEntry violates .equals and .hashCode contracts of HashMap.Entry; leads to non-reflexive .equals, etc.</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-750</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;user&amp;gt; (let &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;h (HashMap.)&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
       (.put h 1 2) &lt;br/&gt;
       (let [p1 (first h) &lt;br/&gt;
             p2 (first {1 2})] &lt;br/&gt;
        (println (.hashCode p1) (.hashCode p2) &lt;br/&gt;
                 (= p1 p2) (= p2 p1) &lt;br/&gt;
                 (.equals p1 p2) (.equals p2 p1))))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 994 false false true false&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;clojure.lang.MapEntry does not follow the contracts of hashCode or equals for java.util.Map$Entry.  This, among other things, leads to the above non-reflexive behavior of .equals.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize this isn't a simple bug; it's a fundamental issue, in that it's impossible to consistently implement both java.util.List and java.util.Map$Entry, which clojure.lang.MapEntry claims to do.  On balance I do find it very useful that Clojure map entries are equivalent to vectors, and probably wouldn't want to give that up.  But, I think that at minimum this wart should be documented somewhere, since it could lead to some very strange and hard to catch bugs.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

I don't know enough about Clojure internals to know if this would entail too large a performance hit, but perhaps it's worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-745] gen-class should allow exposes-methods to expose protected final methods</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-745</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Currently, there is no way in Clojure to call a protected final method of a superclass.  While this may be an acceptable limitation for proxy, gen-class should provide that ability.  Otherwise, one is now forced to create a dummy subclass in Java for the sole purpose of widening the visibility of such methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My patch makes it so that protected final methods may be exposed via the :exposes-methods mechanism.  It is still impossible to override them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-740] Unnecessary boxing of primitives in case form</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-740</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Found this while profiling some performance-critical code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the following Clojure function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;(defn test-&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; ^&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; [^&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;long&lt;/span&gt; i ^&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; d1 ^&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; d2]
  (&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; i)
    0 d1
    d2))&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current Clojure 1.3 snapshot compiles it to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="code-object"&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; invokePrim(&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;long&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="code-object"&gt;double&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="code-object"&gt;double&lt;/span&gt;)   &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; java.lang.Exception;
  Code:
   0:	lload_1
   1:	invokestatic	#67; &lt;span class="code-comment"&gt;//Method clojure/lang/RT.intCast:(J)I
&lt;/span&gt;   4:	istore	7
   6:	iload	7
   8:	i2l
   9:	invokestatic	#73; &lt;span class="code-comment"&gt;//Method clojure/lang/Numbers.num:(J)Ljava/lang/&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;/span&gt;   12:	invokestatic	#79; &lt;span class="code-comment"&gt;//Method clojure/lang/Util.hash:(Ljava/lang/&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;;)I
&lt;/span&gt;   15:	iconst_0
   16:	ishr
   17:	iconst_1
   18:	iand
   19:	tableswitch{ &lt;span class="code-comment"&gt;//0 to 0
&lt;/span&gt;		0: 36;
		&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;: 58 }
   36:	iload	7
   38:	i2l
   39:	invokestatic	#73; &lt;span class="code-comment"&gt;//Method clojure/lang/Numbers.num:(J)Ljava/lang/&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;/span&gt;   42:	getstatic	#45; &lt;span class="code-comment"&gt;//Field const__3:Ljava/lang/&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;/span&gt;   45:	invokestatic	#83; &lt;span class="code-comment"&gt;//Method clojure/lang/Util.equals:(Ljava/lang/&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;;Ljava/lang/&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;;)Z
&lt;/span&gt;   48:	ifeq	58
   51:	dload_3
   52:	invokestatic	#88; &lt;span class="code-comment"&gt;//Method java/lang/&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;Double&lt;/span&gt;.valueOf:(D)Ljava/lang/&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;Double&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;/span&gt;   55:	&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;goto&lt;/span&gt;	63
   58:	dload	5
   60:	invokestatic	#88; &lt;span class="code-comment"&gt;//Method java/lang/&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;Double&lt;/span&gt;.valueOf:(D)Ljava/lang/&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;Double&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;/span&gt;   63:	checkcast	#92; &lt;span class="code-comment"&gt;//class java/lang/&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;   66:	invokevirtual	#96; &lt;span class="code-comment"&gt;//Method java/lang/&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;.doubleValue:()D
&lt;/span&gt;   69:	dreturn
}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bytecode contains boxing of primitives (calls to clojure/lang/Numbers.num and java/lang/Double.valueOf) and calls to clojure/lang/Util.hash and clojure/lang/Util.equals that does not seem necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 60-66 primitive double is boxed into Double only to be converted back into primitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The equivalent Java code compiles to much simpler and faster bytecode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="code-object"&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; testCase(&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;long&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="code-object"&gt;double&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="code-object"&gt;double&lt;/span&gt;);
  Code:
   0:	lload_1
   1:	l2i
   2:	lookupswitch{ &lt;span class="code-comment"&gt;//1
&lt;/span&gt;		0: 20;
		&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;: 22 }
   20:	dload_3
   21:	dreturn
   22:	dload	5
   24:	dreturn
}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="preformattedContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;(defn test-case ^double [^long i ^double d1 ^double d2]

    d2))
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;now emits as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="preformattedContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt; 0  lload_1 [i]
 1  invokestatic clojure.lang.RT.intCast(long) : int [67]

&lt;p&gt;or if the int cast of the expression is omitted:&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>[CLJ-735] Improve error message when a protocol method is not found</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-735</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you call a protocol function but pass the wrong arity (forget an argument for example), you currently a message that says "No single method ... of interface ... found for function ... of protocol ...".  The code in question is getting matching methods from the Reflector and creates this message if the number of matches != 1.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are really two cases there:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="alternate" type="square"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;matches == 0 - this happens frequently due to typos&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;matches &amp;gt; 1 - this presumably happens infrequently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I propose that the == 0 case instead should have slightly different text at the beginning and a hint as to the intended arity within it: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"No method: ... of interface ... with arity ... found for function ... of protocol ...".  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;gt;1 case should have similar changes:  "Multiple methods: ... of interface ... with arity ... found for function ... of protocol ...".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patch is attached.  I used case which presumably should have better performance than a nested if/else.  I was not sure whether the reported arity should match the actual Java method arity or Clojure protocol function arity (including the target).  I did the former.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not add a test as I wasn't sure whether checking error messages in tests was appropriate or not.  Happy to add that if requested.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <comment id="26570" author="cemerick" created="Thu, 14 Jul 2011 04:39:26 -0700">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was not sure whether the reported arity should match the actual Java method arity or Clojure protocol function arity (including the target). I did the former.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it should be the latter.  The message is emitted when the protocol methods are being invoked through the corresponding function, so it should be consistent with the errors emitted by regular functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;+1 for some tests, too.  There certainly are tests for reflection warnings and such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FWIW, I'm happy to take this on if Alex is otherwise occupied.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-731] Create macro to variadically unroll a combinator function definition</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-731</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Clojure contains a set of combinators that are implemented in a similar, but slightly different way.  That is, they are implemented as a complete set of variadic overloads on both the call-side and also on the functions that they return.  Visually, they all tend to look something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="preformattedContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;(defn foo
  ([f]
     (fn
       ([] do stuff...)
       ([x] do stuff...)
       ([x y] do stuff...)
       ([x y z] do stuff...)
       ([x y z &amp;amp; args] do variadic stuff...)))
  ([f1 f2]
     (fn
       ([] do stuff...)
       ([x] do stuff...)
       ([x y] do stuff...)
       ([x y z] do stuff...)
       ([x y z &amp;amp; args] do variadic stuff...)))
  ([f1 f2 f3]
     (fn
       ([] do stuff...)
       ([x] do stuff...)
       ([x y] do stuff...)
       ([x y z] do stuff...)
       ([x y z &amp;amp; args] do variadic stuff...)))
  ([f1 f2 f3 &amp;amp; fs]
     (fn
       ([] do stuff...)
       ([x] do stuff...)
       ([x y] do stuff...)
       ([x y z] do stuff...)
       ([x y z &amp;amp; args] do variadic stuff...))))
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build this type of function for each combinator is tedious and error-prone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There must be a way to implement a macro that takes a "specification" of a combinator including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. name&lt;br/&gt;
2. docstring&lt;br/&gt;
3. do stuff template&lt;br/&gt;
4. do variadic stuff template&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And builds something like the function &lt;tt&gt;foo&lt;/tt&gt; above.  This macro should be able to implement the current batch of combinators (assuming that &lt;a href="http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-730"&gt;http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-730&lt;/a&gt; is completed first for the sake of verification).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                        <description>&lt;p&gt;The tests in &lt;tt&gt;other_functions.clj&lt;/tt&gt; for the combinator functions are tenuous in some cases (&lt;tt&gt;comp&lt;/tt&gt;) and missing in others (&lt;tt&gt;juxt&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;partial&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;complement&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;constantly&lt;/tt&gt;).  It would be nice to have a full suite of combinator tests moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be happy to write the needed tests.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-706</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;From the mailing list &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/msg/c41d909bd58e4534"&gt;http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/msg/c41d909bd58e4534&lt;/a&gt;. It is easy to use deprecated namespaces without knowing you are doing so. The documentation warnings are small, and there is no compiler warning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some possibilities include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;much more visible deprecation styling in the documentation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;stderr warnings when referencing a deprecated thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I don't love the idea of stderr warnings on all the time. Rich: is there an approach to this that you would like to see a patch for?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;The range function's documentation does indicate the following usage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(range 10 0 -1) -&amp;gt; (10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current doc:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returns a lazy seq of nums from start (inclusive) to end&lt;br/&gt;
(exclusive), by step, where start defaults to 0, step to 1, and end&lt;br/&gt;
to infinity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suggestion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returns a lazy seq of nums from start (inclusive) to end&lt;br/&gt;
(exclusive), by step, where start defaults to 0, step to 1, and end&lt;br/&gt;
to infinity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its also possible to step down rather than up, for example counting&lt;br/&gt;
backwards from 10 by -1: (range 10 0 -1).  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <comment id="26134" author="raek" created="Sat, 15 Jan 2011 05:39:05 -0800">&lt;p&gt;The current doc actually mentions the 'step' parameter briefly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;...&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; to end (exclusive), by &lt;b&gt;step&lt;/b&gt;, where start &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;...&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as this might be easy to miss, an addition to the doc is still a good idea, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My suggestion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returns a lazy seq of nums from start (inclusive) to end&lt;br/&gt;
(exclusive), by step, where start defaults to 0, step to 1, and end&lt;br/&gt;
to infinity. &lt;b&gt;Step may be negative to count backwards.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/be0c45b3a4f3d46/36337ac7260d7d0a?lnk=gst&amp;amp;q=writeclassfile#36337ac7260d7d0a"&gt;Discussion&lt;/a&gt; about timing issues when writing class files led to the the current implementation of synchronous writes to disk. This leads to bad performance/system-load when compiling Clojure code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure-dev/browse_thread/thread/23213b787d3ec60f#"&gt;Discussion&lt;/a&gt; questioned the current implentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Synchronous writes are not necessary and also do not ensure (crash while calling write) valid classfiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These Patches (0001 is just a code cleanup for creating the directory structure) ensures atomic creation of classfiles by using File.renameTo()&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Removing sync makes clojure build much faster.  I wonder why it was added in the first place?  I guess only Rich knows?  I assume that it is not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we are removing sync though, I wouldn't bother with the atomic rename stuff.  Doing that sort of thing can cause problems on some platforms, eg with search indexers and virus checkers momentarily locking files after they are created.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patch seems to be assuming that sync is there for some reason, but my initial assumption would be that sync isn't necessary - perhaps it was working around some issue that no longer exists?&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>[CLJ-701] Compiler loses 'loop's return type in some cases</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-701</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;(set! *warn-on-reflection* &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;)
(fn [] (loop [b 0] (recur (loop [a 1] a))))&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generates the following warnings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="preformattedContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;recur arg for primitive local: b is not matching primitive, had: Object, needed: long
Auto-boxing loop arg: b
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is interesting for several reasons.  For one, if the arg to &lt;tt&gt;recur&lt;/tt&gt; is a &lt;tt&gt;let&lt;/tt&gt; form, there is no warning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;(fn [] (loop [b 0] (recur (let [a 1] a))))&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the compiler appears to understand the return type of &lt;tt&gt;loop&lt;/tt&gt; forms just fine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;(use '[clojure.contrib.repl-utils :only [expression-info]])
(expression-info '(loop [a 1] a))
;=&amp;gt; {:class &lt;span class="code-object"&gt;long&lt;/span&gt;, :primitive? &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem can of course be worked around using an explicit cast on the &lt;tt&gt;loop&lt;/tt&gt; form:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;(fn [] (loop [b 0] (recur (&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;long&lt;/span&gt; (loop [a 1] a)))))&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="preformattedContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;(fn [] (loop [b 0] (recur (loop [a 1] a))))
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;gets converted into&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="preformattedContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;(fn [] (loop [b 0] (recur ((fn [] (loop [a 1] a))))))
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;see the code in the compiler:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/src/jvm/clojure/lang/Compiler.java#L5572"&gt;http://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/src/jvm/clojure/lang/Compiler.java#L5572&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;this conversion already bites you if you have mutable fields in a deftype and want to 'set! them in a loop&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;(:x (transient #{:x}))&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;nil&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                    <comment id="26104" author="aredington" created="Fri, 7 Jan 2011 12:07:04 -0800">&lt;p&gt;This is caused by expectations in clojure.lang.RT regarding the type of collections for some methods, e.g. contains() and getFrom(). Checking for contains looks to see if the instance passed in is Associative (a subinterface of PersistentCollection), or IPersistentSet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This patch refactors several of the Clojure interfaces so that logic abstract from the issue of immutability is pulled out to a general interface (e.g. ISet, IAssociative), but preserves the contract specified (e.g. Associatives only return Associatives when calling assoc()).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With more general interfaces in place the contains() and getFrom() methods were then altered to conditionally use the general interfaces which are agnostic of persistence vs. transience. Includes tests in transients.clj to verify the changes fix this problem.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="26188" author="stu" created="Fri, 28 Jan 2011 08:35:08 -0800">&lt;p&gt;Rich: Patch doesn't currently apply, but I would like to get your take on approach here. In particular:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;this represents working back from the defect to rethinking abstractions (good!). Does it go far enough?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;what are good names for the interfaces introduced here?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

                    <comment id="27908" author="jafingerhut" created="Wed, 7 Mar 2012 01:23:01 -0800">&lt;p&gt;Sigh.  Git patches applied via 'git am' are fragile beasts indeed.  Look at them the wrong way and they fail to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;clj-700-patch3.txt applies cleanly to latest master as of Mar 7, 2012, but &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; if you use this command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;git am -s &amp;lt; clj-700-patch3.txt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am pretty sure this is because of DOS CR/LF line endings in the file src/jvm/clojure/lang/Associative.java.  The patch does apply cleanly if you use this command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;git am --keep-cr -s &amp;lt; clj-700-patch3.txt&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="27998" author="jafingerhut" created="Fri, 23 Mar 2012 16:34:38 -0700">&lt;p&gt;This ticket was changed to Incomplete and waiting on Rich when Stuart Halloway asked for feedback on the approach on 28/Jan/2011.  Stuart Sierra changed it to not waiting on Rich on 17/Feb/2012 when he noted the patch didn't apply cleanly.  Latest patch clj-700-patch3.txt does apply cleanly, but doesn't change the approach used since the time Stuart Halloway's concern was raised.  Should it be marked as waiting on Rich again?  Something else?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

Which directly contradicts documentation for deftype&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the method bodies, the (unqualified) name can be used to name the class (for calls to new, instance? etc).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-669] clojure.java.io/do-copy: use java.nio  for Files</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-669</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;NIO Channels reduce CPU/Disk load when copying Files (by using&lt;br/&gt;
syscalls like sendfile internally on Linux/Solaris).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CPU-Load goes from 100% to 0% on my system when copying large files, because no userspace-copying is involved:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patch: &lt;a href="http://github.com/juergenhoetzel/clojure/commit/2b5ab103cbcfe6c49236ac6966c032d3c922233d"&gt;http://github.com/juergenhoetzel/clojure/commit/2b5ab103cbcfe6c49236ac6966c032d3c922233d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <comment id="27861" author="jafingerhut" created="Fri, 24 Feb 2012 16:47:18 -0800">&lt;p&gt;clj-667-allow-loop-recur-nested-in-catch-and-finally-patch2.txt applies cleanly to latest master as of Feb 24, 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot vouch for the changes in Compiler.java &amp;#8211; I simply modified what was in Juha Arpiainen's patch so that they applied cleanly.  Some of the context changed noticeably due to a patch for &lt;a href="http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-31" title="GC Issue 27: Disallow recur across try"&gt;&lt;del&gt;CLJ-31&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Kevin Downey that was applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The test parts of the patch I can vouch for.  Some of the previously existing tests seem not to test what they should.  I can make a separate patch with just the updated passing tests if that is desired.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-666] Add support for Big* numeric types to Reflector</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-666</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;This should work as expected, for example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;(Integer. 1N)&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably for &lt;tt&gt;BigInt&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;BigInteger&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;BigDecimal&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Method to look at is &lt;tt&gt;c.l.Reflector.paramArgTypeMatch&lt;/tt&gt;, per Rich in irc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <comment id="26394" author="trptcolin" created="Wed, 27 Apr 2011 14:41:39 -0700">&lt;p&gt;This patch fails a test around bit-shifting a BigInt: `(bit-shift-left 1N 10000)`. The reason is that the patch changes the dispatch of (BigInt, Long) from (Object, Object) to (long, int). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly this can't be applied (unless another change makes it possible), but I'm putting it up as a start of the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="26395" author="ataggart" created="Wed, 27 Apr 2011 15:26:04 -0700">&lt;p&gt;My comment from the mailing list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the test breaks it likely means Numbers.shiftLeft(long,int) was &lt;br/&gt;
selected over Numbers.shiftLeft(Object,Object).  Given that 1N is an &lt;br/&gt;
Object (one that can exceed the size of a long), the method selection &lt;br/&gt;
is incorrect, thus the patch is broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suggestion of "simply" modifying paramArgTypeMatch is not sufficient since the mechanism for preferring one method over another lives in Compiler, and isn't smart enough to make these sorts of decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;Still a valid issue, but de-prioritized as per Rich.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-457] lazy recursive definition giving incorrect results</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-457</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you define a global data var in terms of a lazy sequence referring to that same var, you can get different results depending on the chunkiness of laziness of the functions being used to build the collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clojure's lazy sequences don't promise to support this, but they shouldn't return wrong answers. In the example given in &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/1c342fad8461602d"&gt;http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/1c342fad8461602d&lt;/a&gt; (and repeated below), Clojure should not return bad data. An error message would be good, and even an infinite loop would be more reasonable than the current behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;(def nums (drop 2 (range)))
(def primes (cons (first nums)
             (lazy-seq (-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
               (&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;rest&lt;/span&gt; nums)
               (remove
                 (fn [x]
                   (let [dividors (take-&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; #(&amp;lt;= (* % %) x)
primes)]
                     (println (str &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"primes = "&lt;/span&gt; primes))
                     (some #(= 0 (rem x %)) dividors))))))))
(take 5 primes)

It prints out:
(primes = (2)
primes = (2)
primes = (2)
primes = (2)
primes = (2)
primes = (2)
primes = (2)
primes = (2)
primes = (2)
primes = (2)
primes = (2)
primes = (2)
primes = (2)
primes = (2)
primes = (2)
primes = (2)
primes = (2)
primes = (2)
primes = (2)
primes = (2)
primes = (2)
primes = (2)
primes = (2)
primes = (2)
primes = (2)
primes = (2)
primes = (2)
primes = (2)
primes = (2)
2 3 5 7 9)&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-450] Add default predicate argument to filter, every?, take-while</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-450</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Some seq processing functions that take predicates could be improved by the addition of a default value of identity for the predicate argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been discussed on the mailing list, and people seem favorable:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/600559b7ee261908/3bc5d144ac54854e?lnk=gst&amp;amp;q=filter+identity#3bc5d144ac54854e"&gt;http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/600559b7ee261908/3bc5d144ac54854e?lnk=gst&amp;amp;q=filter+identity#3bc5d144ac54854e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can put together a patch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-445] Method/Constructor resolution does not factor in widening conversion of primitive args</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-445</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Problem:&lt;br/&gt;
When making java calls (or inlined functions), if both args and param are primitive, no widening conversion is used to locate the proper overloaded method/constructor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;user=&amp;gt; (&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt;. (&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt; 0))
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No matching ctor found &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; class java.lang.&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt; (NO_SOURCE_FILE:0)
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;
The above occurs because there is no &lt;span class="code-object"&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;) constructor, though it should match on &lt;span class="code-object"&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;).
&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;user=&amp;gt; (bit-shift-left (&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt; 1) 1)
Reflection warning, NO_SOURCE_PATH:3 - call to shiftLeft can't be resolved.
2&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above, a call is made via reflection to Numbers.shiftLeft(Object, Object) and its associated auto-boxing, instead of directly to the perfectly adequate Numbers.shiftLeft(long, int).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workarounds:&lt;br/&gt;
Explicitly casting to the formal type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ancillary benefits of fixing:&lt;br/&gt;
It would also reduce the amount of method overloading, e.g., RT.intCast(char), intCast(byte), intCast(short), could all be removed, since such calls would pass to RT.intCast(int).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <comment id="26214" author="ataggart" created="Tue, 8 Feb 2011 16:27:03 -0800">&lt;p&gt;In working on implementing support for vararg methods, I found a number of flaws with the previous solutions.  Please disregard them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've attached a single patch (reflector-compiler-numbers.diff) which is a rather substantial overhaul of the Reflector code, with some enhancements to the Compiler and Numbers code.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patch notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="alternate" type="square"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Moved reflection functionality from Compiler to Reflector.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Reflector supports finding overloaded methods by widening conversion, boxing conversion, and casting.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;During compilation Reflector attempts to find best wildcard match.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Reflector refers to &lt;tt&gt;&amp;#42;unchecked-math*&lt;/tt&gt; when reflectively invoking methods and constructors.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Both Reflector and Compiler support variable arity java methods and constructor; backwards compatible with passing an array or nil in the vararg slot.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Added more informative error messages to Reflector.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Added tests to clojure.test-clojure.reflector.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Altered overloaded functions of clojure.lang.Numbers to service Object/double/long params; fixes some ambiguity issues and avoids unnecessary boxing in some cases.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Patch closes issues 380, 440, 445, 666, and possibly 259 (not enough detail provided).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: clojure.lang.Numbers.lt(JLjava/lang/&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;;)&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but only when using compiled code, e.g. the same code works in the REPL and then fails after compilation. Haven't been able to isolate an example that I can share here yet, but hoping this will cause someone to have an "a, hah" moment...&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                    <comment id="26399" author="ataggart" created="Thu, 28 Apr 2011 11:19:50 -0700">&lt;p&gt;To better facilitate understanding of the changes, I've broken them up into two patches, each with a number of isolable, incremental commits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;reorg-reflector.patch:&lt;/b&gt; Moves the reflection/invocation code from Compiler to Reflector, and eliminates redundant code.  The result is a single code base for resolving methods/constructors, which will allow for altering that mechanism without excess external coordination.  &lt;em&gt;This contains no behaviour changes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;prim-conversion.patch:&lt;/b&gt; Depends on the above. Alters the method/constructor resolution process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;more consistent with java resolution, especially when calling pre-1.5 APIs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;adds support for widening conversion of primitive numerics of the same category (this is more strict than java, and more clojuresque)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;adds support for wildcard matches at compile-time (i.e., you don't need to type-hint every arg to avoid reflection).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This also provides a base to add further features, e.g., &lt;a href="http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-666" title="Add support for Big* numeric types to Reflector"&gt;CLJ-666&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="26406" author="ataggart" created="Fri, 29 Apr 2011 13:01:22 -0700">&lt;p&gt;It's documented in situ, but here are the conversion rules that the reflector uses to find methods:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;By Type:
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;object to ancestor type&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;primitive to a wider primitive of the same numeric category (new)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Boxing:
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;boxed number to its primitive&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;boxed number to a wider primitive of the same numeric category (new for Short and Byte args)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;primitive to its boxed value&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;primitive to Number or Object (new)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Casting:
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;long to int&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;double to float&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

            <title>[CLJ-440] java method calls cannot omit varargs</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-440</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/7d0d6cb32656a621"&gt;http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/7d0d6cb32656a621&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g., trying to call java.util.Collections.addAll(Collection c, T... elements)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;user=&amp;gt; (Collections/addAll [] (object-array 0))
&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
user=&amp;gt; (Collections/addAll [])
IllegalArgumentException No matching method: addAll  clojure.lang.&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;Compiler&lt;/span&gt;$StaticMethodExpr.&amp;lt;init&amp;gt; (&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;Compiler&lt;/span&gt;.java:1401)&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Method class provides an isVarArg() method, which could be used to inform the compiler to process things differently.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Note: subseq currently returns () instead of nil in some situations. If the rest of this idea dies we might still want to fix that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-416] improvments on agent</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-416</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;hi,i have some ideas to improve the agent system:&lt;br/&gt;
1.Agent's thread pool must use a custom ThreadFactory to new threads.Set new thread a system name and set it to be daemon.Thread's name would be used for debug or monitor.And set thread to be daemon asking user to shutdown agents explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.Beacause agent's thread is daemon,so if a application doesn't use any agents,the thread pool must not started.I think the agent's thread pools should be lazy initialized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.I think agent must allow use to define a agent-own thread pool.That thread pool is only used by a agent,not global.just like:&lt;br/&gt;
(define a (agent :executor (java.util.concurrent.Executors/newFixedThreadPool 2)))&lt;br/&gt;
or&lt;br/&gt;
(set-executor!  a  (java.util.concurrent.Executors/newFixedThreadPool 2))&lt;br/&gt;
And then,a new function to shutdown agent's custom thread pool:&lt;br/&gt;
(shutdown-agent a)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do we need a custom thread pool?&lt;br/&gt;
First, the default thread pool is global, send use the thread pool&lt;br/&gt;
is a fixed size cpus +2, is likely to become the system bottleneck&lt;br/&gt;
sometime. Although you can use the send-off, use the cache thread&lt;br/&gt;
pool, but in a real world application, I can not use the cache thread&lt;br/&gt;
pool, which will introduce the risk of OutOfMemoryError, normally I&lt;br/&gt;
like to use a fixed-size thread pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the actions which global thread pool execute are from a&lt;br/&gt;
variety of agents, the actions are not homogeneous, and can not&lt;br/&gt;
maximize the efficient use of the thread pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are my suggestions on agent,thanks for this great language,i enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <comment id="24162" author="importer" created="Tue, 24 Aug 2010 15:41:00 -0700">&lt;p&gt;alexdmiller said: A simple example I tried for illustration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;user=&amp;gt; (let [a 1 b 2] (&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; (= a b)))
#&amp;lt;CompilerException java.lang.AssertionError: Assert failed: (= a b)
 a : 1
 b : 2&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="24163" author="importer" created="Tue, 24 Aug 2010 15:41:00 -0700">&lt;p&gt;fogus said: Of course it's weird if you do something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;(let [x 1 y 2 z 3 a 1 b 2 c 3] (&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; (= x y)))
java.lang.AssertionError: Assert failed: (= x y)
 x : 1
 y : 2
 z : 3
 a : 1
 b : 2
 c : 3
 (NO_SOURCE_FILE:0)
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

So maybe it could be slightly changed to:
&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;(defmacro &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"Evaluates expr and &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; an exception &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; it does not evaluate to logical &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;."&lt;/span&gt;
  {:added &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"1.0"&lt;/span&gt;}
  [x]
  (when *&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt;*
    (let [bindings (local-bindings &amp;amp;env)]
      `(when-not ~x
         (let [sep#  (&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;/getProperty &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"line.separator"&lt;/span&gt;)
               form# '~x]
           (&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; (AssertionError. (apply str &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"Assert failed: "&lt;/span&gt; (pr-str form#) sep#
                                          (map (fn [[k# v#]] 
                                                 (when (some #{k#} form#) 
                                                   (str &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"\t"&lt;/span&gt; k# &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;" : "&lt;/span&gt; v# sep#))) 
                                               ~bindings)))))))))
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

So that. now it's just:
&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;(let [x 1 y 2 z 3 a 1 b 2 c 3] (&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; (= x y)))
java.lang.AssertionError: Assert failed: (= x y)
 x : 1
 y : 2
 (NO_SOURCE_FILE:0)&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

So maybe it's better just to print all of the locals unless you really want to get complicated.&lt;br/&gt;
:f&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="24165" author="importer" created="Tue, 24 Aug 2010 15:41:00 -0700">&lt;p&gt;jawolfe said: See also some comments in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure-dev/browse_frm/thread/68d49cd7eb4a4899/9afc6be4d3f8ae27?lnk=gst&amp;amp;q=assert#9afc6be4d3f8ae27"&gt;http://groups.google.com/group/clojure-dev/browse_frm/thread/68d49cd7eb4a4899/9afc6be4d3f8ae27?lnk=gst&amp;amp;q=assert#9afc6be4d3f8ae27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus one more suggestion to add to the mix:  in addition to / instead of printing the locals, how about saving them somewhere.  For example, the var &lt;b&gt;assert-bindings&lt;/b&gt; could be bound to the map of locals.  This way you don't run afoul of infinite/very large sequences, and allow the user to do more detailed interrogation of the bad values (especially useful when some of the locals print opaquely).&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

This would have been useful last week when I had an assertion that failed only on the CI box, where no debugger is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rich, at the risk of beating a dead horse, I still think this is a good idea. Debuggers are not always available, and this is an example of where a Lisp is intrinsically capable of providing better information than can be had in other environments.

                    <comment id="26461" author="jweiss" created="Fri, 27 May 2011 06:16:40 -0700">&lt;p&gt;A slight improvement I made in my own version of this code:  flatten does not affect set literals.  So if you do (assert (some #{x} &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;a b c d&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;))  the value of x will not be printed.  Here's a modified flatten that does the job:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-none"&gt;(defn symbols [sexp]
  "Returns just the symbols from the expression, including those
   inside literals (sets, maps, lists, vectors)."
  (distinct (filter symbol? (tree-seq coll? seq sexp))))&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-401] Promote "seqable?" from contrib?</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-401</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;This was vaguely discussed &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/c9eef488d27bdf37"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and could potenntially help &lt;a href="http://www.assembla.com/spaces/clojure/support/tickets/400-a-faster-flatten"&gt;this ticket&lt;/a&gt; as well as be generally useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't speak for everyone but when I saw sequential? I assumed it would have the semantics that seqable? does. Just my opinion, I'd love to hear someone's who is more informed than mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the proposed patch referenced in the ticket above, if seqable? could be used in place of sequential? flatten could be more powerful and work with maps/sets/java collections. Here's how it would look:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;(defn flatten [coll]
  (lazy-seq
    (when-let [coll (seq coll)]
      (let [x (first coll)]
        (&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (seqable? x)
          (concat (flatten x) (flatten (next coll)))
          (cons x (flatten (next coll))))))))&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;user=&amp;gt; (flatten #{1 2 3 #{4 5 {6 {7 &lt;a href="#tok1-block-tok"&gt;8 9 10 #�tok1-block-tok&lt;/a&gt;}}}})&lt;br/&gt;
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-400] A faster flatten</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-400</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;As discussed in &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/c9eef488d27bdf37"&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt;, I am submitting a more performant version of flatten for review. It has the same semantics as the current core/flatten. I have also updated the doc string to say that "(flatten nil) returns the empty list", because that's what the current version of core/flatten does as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven't mailed in a CA yet, but I will tomorrow morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Of course I'd mess my first ticket up &lt;img class="emoticon" src="http://dev.clojure.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/&gt;. I am not immediately seeing an option to edit this to add the "patch" tag or add the "ready to test" action. Sorry folks&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-396] Better support for multiple inheritance in hierarchies and multimethods</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-396</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;While the hierarchies produced with 'derive' allow multiple parents per child, there is no way to indicate precedence between those parents, other than by laboriously specifying 'prefer-method' for every type X every multimethod. When 2 multimethods are both applicable to the supplied arguments, Clojure produces a nonspecific IllegalArgumentException containing only an error string. All this means that while Clojure does have an "inheritance" mechanism in the form of the ad hoc hierarchies, it is currently not really possible to implement multiple inheritance using the ad hoc hierarchy mechanism. 'Prefer-method' will not scale up to use in large applications with complex type hierarchies and heavy use of multimethods. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some potential ways to solve this are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="alternate" type="square"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;allowing 'defmulti' to take a 'tie-breaker' function (tie-breaker &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;arglist speclist1 speclist2&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; ...) which is called instead of throwing an IllegalArgumentException, and must return the 'winning speclist'.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;instead of throwing IllegalArgumentException, throw a TiedMultiMethodsException &amp;#8211; the exception instance should contain the offending speclists, the function, and the arguments that were supplied.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;allowing specification of precedence when using 'derive' (if only via a "last in = highest precedence" rule).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes one would like to know if an object is an instance of a deftype or a defrecord.&lt;br/&gt;
Add (possibly empty) marker Interfaces that allow an efficient test, plus test fns&lt;br/&gt;
'record?' and 'deftype?'.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You can use instance? with those interfaces.  I'm not sure if they're actually documented for public use, but they seem to work as expected in 1.3 and 1.4.  If you want record?, you can try this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(defn record? &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;rec&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; (instance? clojure.lang.IRecord rec))&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-379] problem with classloader when run as windows service</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-379</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;I found following error when I run clojure application as MS Windows service (via procrun from Apache Daemon project).  When I tried to do 'require' during run-time, I got NullPointerException.  This happened as baseLoader function from RT class returned null in such environment (the value of Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader()).  (Although my app works fine when I run my application as standalone program, not as service).&lt;br/&gt;
This error was fixed by explicit setting of class loader with following code: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(.setContextClassLoader (Thread/currentThread) (java.lang.ClassLoader/getSystemClassLoader))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;before any call to 'require'....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May be you need to modify 'baseLoader' function, so it will check is value of Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader() is null or not, and if null, then return value of java.lang.ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader() ?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-373] update-in with empty key paths</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-373</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;To the topic of get-in and update-in. While I realize this is not a bug it is odd and in my eyes unexpected and unwanted behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;get-in called with an empty path returns the hashmap it was given to walk through - this is as I expect and makes a lot of sense when dynamically (with generated pathes ) walking a hash map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;update-in behaves differently and while from the implementation side, it's behavior too makes sense, it does not work as expected (at least not for me) update-in with an empty map creates a new key 'nil' so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(update-in {...} [] f) ist he same as (update-in {...} &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;nil&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; f) while (get-in {...} []) is not the same as (get-in {...} &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;nil&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;) and of cause differs from what update-in does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For automatically walking trees the behavior of get-in makes a lot more sense since the current behavior of update-in forces you to check for empty paths and if they are empty fall back to plain assoc and get (or get-in since this works):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;(&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;-let [r (butlast @path)]
(&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  (alter m update-in r dissoc (last @path))
  (alter m update-in r assoc {:name @sr} c))
(&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  (alter m dissoc (last @path))
  (alter m assoc {:name @sr} c)))&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next argument is that update-in with an empty map working on nil isn't easy to gasp, one needs to know the implementation details to realize that it works, I think 90% of the people reading update-in with [] will not instinctively know that it works on the key nil, so changing this would most likely not break any current code, and if it would the code would be bad anyway &lt;img class="emoticon" src="http://dev.clojure.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/tongue.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chouser has, a very nice solution on the mailing list that would fix the problem I'm not sure if I'm entitled to post it here since I did not wrote it but it can be found in this thread: &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/de5b20b8c3fe498b?hl=en"&gt;http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/de5b20b8c3fe498b?hl=en&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    <comment id="25938" author="chouser@n01se.net" created="Sat, 13 Nov 2010 16:37:53 -0800">&lt;p&gt;I've attached my code from the g.group thread in the form of a patch, in case it's sufficient.  (Thanks to abedra for the gentle kick in the pants.)&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="25974" author="stu" created="Mon, 29 Nov 2010 06:20:59 -0800">&lt;p&gt;Looks to me like the patch is misusing if-let, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;(when-let [[k &amp;amp; mk] []] &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"Doh!"&lt;/span&gt;) 
=&amp;gt; Doh!&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please correct, and add tests for &lt;tt&gt;nil&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;[]&lt;/tt&gt; keys (at least).&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="28412" author="scottlowe" created="Tue, 8 May 2012 10:20:53 -0700">&lt;p&gt;I will write some tests and correct this.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="28419" author="scottlowe" created="Wed, 9 May 2012 18:39:11 -0700">&lt;p&gt;I'm sorry to report that my good intentions of wanting to help clear some of the project backlog has created more work by way of further questions. I'd also like to clarify the desired new behaviours for the test cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heinz proposed that an empty key sequence will not create a new nil key in the returned map.&lt;br/&gt;
He also suggested that the following behaviour changes be made (compare old and new* behaviours):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="preformattedContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt; 
(update-in {1 2} [] (constantly {2 3}))
{nil {2 3}, 1 2}

(update-in* {1 2} [] (constantly {2 3}))
{2 3}

(update-in {1 2} [] assoc  1 3)
{nil {1 3}, 1 2}

(update-in* {1 2} [] assoc  1 3)
{1 3}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Chouser also added that nil keys should be honoured, as before:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="preformattedContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt; 
(update-in* {nil 2} [nil] (constantly 3))
{nil 3}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I've added a variety of tests to cover the existing behaviour and would like to confirm that the above is all that's required for new behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patch from November 2010 didn't work, but I tweaked it with a &lt;em&gt;when-let&lt;/em&gt; as Stuart suggested and placed a check for an empty sequence of keys before the &lt;em&gt;when-let&lt;/em&gt; block; because essentially, the primary behaviour change boils down to simply handling an empty sequence of keys, in addition to the existing behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not entirely convinced that these changes are a good thing, but at least there's now something concrete for discussion. Please have a look at what is there. The good news is that at least there are some tests covering &lt;em&gt;update-in&lt;/em&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-366] Multiplatform command-line clojure launcher</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-366</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Clojure needs a lower barrier of entry, long java commands scare people away! We need a script that conveniently launches a clojure repl or executes clojure files, much like the ruby/python/perl/other-favorite-interpreted-language behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTES:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Russ Olson (regarding Dejure/Dejour):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I just fixed a bunch of bugs in the script, so make sure you get the latest from download from: &lt;a href="http://github.com/russolsen/dejour"&gt;http://github.com/russolsen/dejour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;After looking at jruby, scala, and groovy, it seems that the only way to do this right on windows is to write a C or C++ program and have a .exe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <title>[CLJ-348] reify allows use of qualified name as method parameter</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-348</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;This should complain about using a fully-qualified name as a parameter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(defmacro lookup []&lt;br/&gt;
  `(reify clojure.lang.ILookup&lt;br/&gt;
          (valAt &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;_ key&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;)))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead it simply ignores that parameter in the method body in favour of clojure.core/key.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The true problem is the resolution of key when qualified. Another possibility is to ignore the qualifier there.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; (defmacro lookup []&lt;br/&gt;

                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Filled pretty printing (where we try to fit as many elements on a line as possible) is being too aggressive as we can see when we try to print the following array:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;user&amp;gt; (binding &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;*print-right-margin* 20&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; (pprint (int-array (range 10))))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Produces:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[0,&lt;br/&gt;
 1,&lt;br/&gt;
 2,&lt;br/&gt;
 3,&lt;br/&gt;
 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[0, 1, 2, 3, 4,&lt;br/&gt;
 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or something like that. (I haven't worked through the exact correct representation for this case).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We currently only use :fill style newlines for native java arrays.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;:as-of allows library authors to specify a known subset of vars to refer from clojure (or &lt;b&gt;any other library&lt;/b&gt; which would use :added metadata).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(ns foo (:refer-clojure :as-of "1.1")) is equivalent to (ns foo (:refer-clojure :only &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;public-documented-vars-which-already-existed-in-1.1&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;))&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-322] Enhance AOT compilation process to emit classfiles only for explicitly-specified namespaces</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-322</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;This was &lt;a href="https://www.assembla.com/spaces/clojure-contrib/tickets/23"&gt;originally/erroneously reported&lt;/a&gt; by Howard Lewis Ship in the clojure-contrib assembla:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;My build file specifies the namespaces to AOT compile but &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; I include another namespace
(even from a JAR dependency) that is not AOT compiled, the other namespace will be compiled as well.

In my &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt;, I was using clojure-contrib's clojure.contrib.str-utils2 namespace, and I got a bunch of
clojure/contrib/str_utils2 classes in my output directory.

I think that the AOT compiler should NOT precompile any namespaces that are transitively reached,
only namespaces in the set specified by the command line are appropriate.

As currently coded, you will frequently find unwanted third-party dependencies in your output JARs;
further, &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; multiple parties depend on the same JARs, &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; could cause bloating and duplication in the
eventual runtime classpath.&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having the option of shipping either all AOT-compiled classfiles or mixed source/AOT depending upon one's distribution requirements would make that phase of work with a clojure codebase significantly easier and less error-prone.  The only question in my mind is what the default should be.  We're all used to the current behaviour, but I'd guess that any nontrivial project where the form of the distributable matters (i.e. the source/AOT mix), providing as much control as possible by default makes the most sense.  Given the tooling that most people are using, it's trivial (and common practice, IIUC) to provide a comprehensive list of namespaces one wishes to compile, so making that the default shouldn't be a hurdle to anyone.  If an escape hatch is desired, a --transitive switch to clojure.lang.Compile could be added.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I've been doing research on Clojure build tools for an upcoming talk and all of them (Maven, Leiningen, Gradle) have the same problem: the AOT compile extends from the desired namespaces (such as one containing a :gen-class)  to every reached namespace.  This is going to cause a real ugliness when application A uses libraries B and C that both depend on library D (such as clojure-contrib) and B and C are thus both bloated with duplicate, unwanted AOT compiled  classes from the library D.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;I am working on a patch that would provide a mechanism for such tooling to disable this default behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="23778" author="importer" created="Mon, 27 Sep 2010 22:18:00 -0700">&lt;p&gt;cemerick said: A first cut of a change to address this issue is here (&lt;b&gt;caution, work in progress!&lt;/b&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://github.com/cemerick/clojure/commit/6f14e0790c0d283a7e44056adf1bb3f36bb16e0e"&gt;http://github.com/cemerick/clojure/commit/6f14e0790c0d283a7e44056adf1bb3f36bb16e0e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes available a new recognized system property, &lt;tt&gt;clojure.compiler.transitive&lt;/tt&gt;, which defaults to &lt;tt&gt;true&lt;/tt&gt;.  When set/bound to false (i.e. &lt;tt&gt;-Dclojure.compiler.transitive=false&lt;/tt&gt; when using &lt;tt&gt;clojure.lang.Compile&lt;/tt&gt;), only the first loaded file (either the ns named in the call to &lt;tt&gt;compile&lt;/tt&gt; or each of the namespaces named as arguments to &lt;tt&gt;clojure.lang.Compile&lt;/tt&gt;) will have classfiles written to disk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that this compilation invocation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;java -cp &amp;lt;your classpath&amp;gt; -Dclojure.compiler.transitive=&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; clojure.lang.Compile com.bar com.baz&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;will generate classfiles only for &lt;tt&gt;com.bar&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;com.baz&lt;/tt&gt;, but not for any of the namespaces or other files they load, require, or use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only shortcoming of this WIP patch is that classfiles &lt;b&gt;are&lt;/b&gt; still generated for proxy and gen-class classes defined outside of the explicitly-named namespaces.  What I thought was a solution for this ended up breaking the loading of generated interfaces (as produced by defprotocol, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll take a second look at this before the end of the week, but wanted to get this out there so as to get any comments people might have.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

I tried compiling from master of Chas's fork on github, but I still got the all the .class files generated with -Dclojure.compiler.transitive=false. It could be a quirk of the way I'm using ant to fork off processes though. Is it possible to set it using System/setProperty, or must it be given as a property on the command-line?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="23780" author="importer" created="Mon, 27 Sep 2010 22:18:00 -0700">&lt;p&gt;cemerick said: Bah, that's just bad documentation. :-/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system property is only provided by &lt;tt&gt;clojure.lang.Compile&lt;/tt&gt;; the value of it drives the binding of &lt;tt&gt;clojure.core/&lt;b&gt;transitive-compile&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, which has a root binding of true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should be able to configure the transitivity the same way you configure &lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;compile-path&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; (system prop to &lt;tt&gt;clojure.lang.Compile&lt;/tt&gt; or a direct binding when at the REPL, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If not, ping me in irc or elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

I have some namespaces which load several parts from different files, but which belong to the same namespace. The most prominent example of such a case is clojure.core itself. I'm find with stopping require and use, but load is a bit too much, I'd say.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;Meikel: Do people actually use load outside of clojure.core? I thought it was only used there because clojure.core is a "special" namespace where you want more vars to be available than can reasonably fit in a single file. Splitting up a namespace into several files is quite unadvisable otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="23783" author="importer" created="Mon, 27 Sep 2010 22:18:00 -0700">&lt;p&gt;technomancy said: I can confirm that this works for me modulo the proxy/gen-class issue that Chas mentioned. I would love to see this in Clojure 1.2; it would really clean up a lot of build-related issues.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="23784" author="importer" created="Mon, 27 Sep 2010 22:18:00 -0700">&lt;p&gt;meikelbrandmeyer said: I used it several times and this is the first time, I hear that it is unadvisable to do so. Even with a lower number of Vars in the namespace (c.c is here certainly exceptional) and might be of use to split several "sections" of code which belong to the same namespace but have different functionality. Whether to use a big comment in the source to indicate the section or split things into subfiles is a matter of taste. But it's a perfectly reasonable thing todo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another use case, where I use this (and c.c.lazy-xml, IIRC) is to conditionally load code depending on whether a dependency is available or not. Eg. vimclojure uses c.c.pprint and c.c.stacktrace/clj-stacktrace transparently depending on their availability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are perfectly legal uses of load. I don't see any "unadvisable" here.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="23785" author="importer" created="Mon, 27 Sep 2010 22:18:00 -0700">&lt;p&gt;cemerick said: Thanks, Meikel; I had forgotten about that use case, as I don't use load directly myself at all.  I probably wouldn't say it's inadvisable, just mostly unnecessary.  In any case, that's a good catch.  It complicates things a bit, but we'll see what happens.  I'm going to take another whack at resolving the proxy/gen-class case and narrowing the impact of nontransitivity to use and require later tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree wholeheartedly that this should be in 1.2, assuming the technical bits work out.  This has been an irritant for quite a long time.  I actually believe that nontransitivity should be the &lt;b&gt;default&lt;/b&gt; &amp;#8211; no one wants or expects to have classfiles show up for dependencies show up when a project is AOT-compiled.  I think the only negative impact would be whoever still fiddles with compilation at the REPL, and doesn't use maven or lein &amp;#8211; and even then, it's just a matter of binding another var.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

Then it's set!-able like the other vars ��� &lt;b&gt;warn-on-reflection&lt;/b&gt; and friends.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for mentioning load, Meikel: it was very helpful in resolving the proxy/gen-class issue as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a single data point: the jar produced by the medium-sized project I've been using for testing the changes has shrunk from 1.8MB to less than 1MB.  That's not the only reason this is a good change, but it's certainly a nice side-effect.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

The &lt;del&gt;compat&lt;/del&gt; one retains the current default behaviour &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;*transitive-compile* true&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;, the other changes the default so that transitivity is a non-default option.  At least of those I've spoken to about this, the latter is preferred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The user impact of changing the default would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The result of compiling from the REPL will change. Getting back current behaviour would require adding a &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;*transitive-compile* true&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; binding to the existing bindings one must set when compiling from the REPL.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The same as #1 goes for those scripting AOT compilation via &lt;tt&gt;clojure.lang.Compile&lt;/tt&gt; as well (whether by shell scripts, ant, etc).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Those using lein, clojure-maven-plugin, gradle, and others will likely have a new option provided by those tools, and perhaps a different default than the language's.  I suspect those using such tools would much prefer a change from the default behaviour in any case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about an option to support  transitive compilation, but only if the Clojure source file being compiled as a file: URL (i.e., its a local file on the file system, not a file stored in a JAR). That would make it easier to use compilation on the local project without transitively compiling imported libraries, such as clojure-contrib.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So &lt;b&gt;transitive-compile&lt;/b&gt; should be a keyword, not a boolean, with values :all (for 1.1 behavior), :none (to compile only the exact specified namespaces) or :local (to compile transitively, but only for local files, not source files from JARs).&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;I thought about this some, and I don't think that's a good idea, at least for now.  I'm uncomfortable with semantics changing depending upon where code is being loaded from &amp;#8211; which, depending upon a tool's implementation, might be undefined.  E.g. if the com.foo.bar ns is available in source form in one directory, but as classes from a jar, and classpaths aren't being constructed in a stable fashion, then the results of compilation will change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we decide that special treatment depending upon the source of code is warranted in the future, that's a fairly straightforward thing to do w.r.t. the API &amp;#8211; we could have :all and :local as you suggest, with nil representing :none.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I am getting an ant build error: "/Users/stuart/repos/clojure/build.xml:137: java.io.FileNotFoundException: Could not locate clojure/test_clojure/aot/nontransitive__init.class or clojure/test_clojure/aot/nontransitive.clj on classpath:"&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It feels icky to have a method named writeClassFile that, under some circumstances, does &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; write a class file, but instead loads it via a dynamic loader. Maybe this is just a naming issue.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Are there any other ways to accomplish the goals of &lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;load-level&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;? Or, taking the other side, if we are going to have a &lt;b&gt;load-level&lt;/b&gt;, are there other possible consumers who might have different needs?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;(Minor) Why the &lt;tt&gt;use :only&lt;/tt&gt; idiom instead of just &lt;tt&gt;require&lt;/tt&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://github.com/stuartsierra/clojure/tree/write-classes"&gt;my forked branch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this patch does:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Keeps 'compile' and '&lt;b&gt;compile-files&lt;/b&gt;' exactly the same&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Adds 'compile-write-classes' to write .class files for specifically named classes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Minor compiler changes to support this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This approach was prompted by the following observations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Java interop is the dominant reason for needing .class files&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Things other than namespaces can generate classes for Java interop:
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;deftype/defrecord&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;defprotocol&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;gen-class/gen-interface&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;For library releases, we want to control which .class files are emitted on a per-class basis, not per-namespace&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Some legitimate uses of AOT compilation will want transitive compilation
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Pre-compiling an entire application before release&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FWIW, I aim to review your comments and SS' approach over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="26035" author="cemerick" created="Thu, 16 Dec 2010 05:36:22 -0800">&lt;p&gt;S. Halloway:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Certainly shouldn't happen.  AFAIK, others have screened the patch, presumably with a successful build.&lt;br/&gt;
2. Agreed; given the approach, I think it's just a bad name.&lt;br/&gt;
3. Yes, I think S. Sierra's is one.  See my next comment.&lt;br/&gt;
4. Because the &lt;tt&gt;:use&lt;/tt&gt; form was already there. I've actually been using that form of &lt;tt&gt;:use&lt;/tt&gt; more and more; I've found that easier than occasionally having to shuffle around specs between &lt;tt&gt;:use&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;:require&lt;/tt&gt;. I think I'm aping Chris Houser in that regard.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="26036" author="cemerick" created="Thu, 16 Dec 2010 07:00:03 -0800">&lt;p&gt;I think S. Sierra's approach is fundamentally superior what I offered.  I have two suggestions: one slight perspective change (which implies no change in the actual implementation), and an idea for an even simpler approach (at least from a user perspective), in that order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While interop is the driving requirement behind AOT, I absolutely do not want to have to keep an updated enumeration of all of the classes resulting from each and every &lt;tt&gt;defrecord&lt;/tt&gt; et al. usages in my &lt;tt&gt;pom.xml&lt;/tt&gt;/&lt;tt&gt;project.clj&lt;/tt&gt; (and I wouldn't wish the task of ferreting those usages and their resulting classnames on any build tool author).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, &lt;tt&gt;&amp;#42;compile-write-classes&amp;#42;&lt;/tt&gt; is documented to be a set of classname strings, but could just as easily be any other function.  &lt;tt&gt;&amp;#42;compile-write-classes&amp;#42;&lt;/tt&gt; should be documented to accept any predicate function (renamed to e.g. &lt;tt&gt;&amp;#42;compile-write-class?&amp;#42;&lt;/tt&gt;?).  There's no reason why it shouldn't be bound to, e.g. &lt;tt&gt;#(re-matches #"foo\.bar\.[\w&amp;#95;]+$" %)&lt;/tt&gt; if I know that all my records are defined in the &lt;tt&gt;foo.bar&lt;/tt&gt; namespace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To go along with that, I think some package/classname-globbing utilities along with corresponding options to &lt;tt&gt;clojure.lang.Compile&lt;/tt&gt; would be most welcome.  Classname munging rules are not exactly obvious, and it'd be good to make things a little easier for users in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a name="Anotheralternative"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Another alternative&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there's a closed set of forms that generate classes that one might reasonably be interested in having in a build result (outside of use cases for pervasive AOT), then why not have a simple option that only those forms utilize?  &lt;tt&gt;gen-class&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;gen-interface&lt;/tt&gt; already do this, but reusing the all-or-nothing &lt;tt&gt;&amp;#42;compile-files&amp;#42;&lt;/tt&gt; binding; if they keyed off of a binding that implied a diminished scope (e.g. &lt;tt&gt;&amp;#42;compile-interop-forms&amp;#42;&lt;/tt&gt; – which would be &lt;tt&gt;true&lt;/tt&gt; if &lt;tt&gt;&amp;#42;compile-files&amp;#42;&lt;/tt&gt; were &lt;tt&gt;true&lt;/tt&gt;), then they'd do exactly what we wanted.  Extending this approach to &lt;tt&gt;deftype&lt;/tt&gt; (and therefore &lt;tt&gt;defrecord&lt;/tt&gt;) &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An implementation of this would probably be somewhat more complicated than S. Sierra's patch, though not as complex as my original stab at the problem (i.e. no &lt;tt&gt;&amp;#42;load-level&amp;#42;&lt;/tt&gt;).  On the plus side:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. No additional configuration for users or implementation work for build tool authors, aside from the addition of the boolean diminished-scope AOT option&lt;br/&gt;
2. Class file generation would remain opaque from a build process standpoint&lt;br/&gt;
3. Future/other class-generating forms (there are a few people futzing with ASM independently, etc) can make local decisions about whether or not to participate in interop-centric classfile generation.  This might be particularly helpful if a given form emits multiple classes, making the determination of a classname-based filter fn less straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can see wanting to further restrict AOT to specific classnames in certain circumstances, in which case the above and S. Sierra's patch might be complimentary.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;If IMeta were a protocol, it could be extended to Class.  That implementation could look for a "well-known" static field, perhaps?  __clojure_meta or something?  Then deftype would just have to populate that field, and get-source would be all set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does that plan have any merit?  Is there a better place to store a file name and line number?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-291] (take-nth 0 coll) redux...</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-291</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;I dont seem to be able make the old ticket uninvalid so here goes&lt;br/&gt;
(take-nth 0 coll) causes (at least on Solaris) infinite space and time consumption&lt;br/&gt;
It's not a printout error as the following code causes the problem too&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(let [j 0&lt;br/&gt;
 firstprod (apply * (doall (map #(- 1 %) (take-nth j (:props mix)))))]) ; from my parameter update function&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used jvisualvm and the jvm is doing some RNI call - no clojure code is running at all&lt;br/&gt;
If left alone it will crash the jvm with all heap space consumed&lt;br/&gt;
0 is an InvalidArgument for take-nth&lt;br/&gt;
I wouldnt mind if it produced an infinite lazy sequence of nils even though thats wrong&lt;br/&gt;
It doesnt do this though it actively destroys the JVM&lt;br/&gt;
Its a bug nasty destructive and it took me half a day to figure out what was going on&lt;br/&gt;
please let someone fix it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

IMHO, the correct behavior is to throw an exception.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;Note however that it is returning an infinite lazy seq.  The example in the issue description seems to include essentially (doall &amp;lt;infinite-lazy-seq&amp;gt;) which does blow the heap:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(doall (range))&lt;/p&gt;

                        <description>&lt;p&gt;The current implementation of merge-with works only with map types that implement the IFn protocol for key lookup. In particular, this means that it doesn't work with map-like types created with deftype. The attached patch replaces the call to the map by a call to clojure.core/get, which works on any map-like type.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-277] Making clojure.xml/emit a little friendler to xml consumers</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-277</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Currently, clojure.xml/emit breaks the eBay api, because emit adds whitespace before and after :contents. This trivial patch fixes it for me:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://github.com/tjg/clojure/commit/bbff079d26e627c655b847319a58d76b8b3cec7c"&gt;http://github.com/tjg/clojure/commit/bbff079d26e627c655b847319a58d76b8b3cec7c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Dunno whether there's a good reason emit works that way, or if I'm missing something obvious.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize that emit's behavior conforms to the XML spec and it's probably eBay at fault here. But I can nevertheless see this whitespace causing problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-274] cannot close over mutable fields (in deftype)</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-274</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Simplest case:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;user=&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;
(deftype Bench &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;#^{:unsynchronized-mutable true} val&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
  Runnable&lt;br/&gt;
  (run &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;_&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    (fn [] (set! val 5))))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cannot assign to non-mutable: val (NO_SOURCE_FILE:5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functions should be able to mutate mutable fields in their surrounding deftype (just like inner classes do in Java).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Filed as bug, because the loop special form expands into a fn form sometimes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;user=&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;
(deftype Bench &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;#^{:unsynchronized-mutable true} val&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
  Runnable&lt;br/&gt;
  (run &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;_&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    (let [x (loop [] (set! val 5))])))&lt;br/&gt;
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cannot assign to non-mutable: val (NO_SOURCE_FILE:9)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-273] def with a function value returns meta {:macro false}, but def itself doesn't have meta</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-273</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;On the master (1.2) branch, if you create a def with an initial function value, {:macro false} is added to the metadata of the return value for def. However, if you look again at the metadata on the var itself, the {:macro false} is not present! This breaks the use of contrib's defalias when aliasing macros, because the new alias is marked as {:macro false}.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code below demonstrates the issue, which was introduced in &lt;a href="http://github.com/richhickey/clojure/commit/430dd4fa711d0008137d7a82d4b4cd27b6e2d6d1"&gt;http://github.com/richhickey/clojure/commit/430dd4fa711d0008137d7a82d4b4cd27b6e2d6d1&lt;/a&gt;, "metadata for fns."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;;; all running on 1.2, DIFF noted in comments

(defmacro foo [])
-&amp;gt; #'user/foo

(meta (def bar (.getRoot #'foo)))
-&amp;gt; {:macro &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;, :ns #&amp;lt;Namespace user&amp;gt;, :name bar, :file &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"NO_SOURCE_PATH"&lt;/span&gt;, :line 83}
;; DIFF: where did that :macro &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; come from??

(def bar (.getRoot #'foo))
-&amp;gt; #'user/bar

(meta #'bar)
-&amp;gt; {:ns #&amp;lt;Namespace user&amp;gt;, :name bar, :file &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"NO_SOURCE_PATH"&lt;/span&gt;, :line 84}
;; LIKE 1.1, but really weird: now the :macro &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; is gone again!&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-272</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Creating this ticket to describe various things people have wanted to change about how ns works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name="Minimalneeds"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Minimal needs  &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;there should be a primitive level of loading (presumably &lt;tt&gt;load&lt;/tt&gt;) that just loads without question.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;the api should be unified across the ns and direct forms. No more keywords or quoting! So &lt;tt&gt;(use foo)&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; not &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;(use 'foo)&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;. This makes &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;use&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; et al macros, so there should also be new fn versions (maybe &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;use*&lt;/tt&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name="Otherpossibilitiestodiscuss."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Other possibilities to discuss.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Feature addressing the {{:like&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;:clone&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; ideas from &lt;a href="http://onclojure.com/2010/02/17/managing-namespaces/"&gt;http://onclojure.com/2010/02/17/managing-namespaces/&lt;/a&gt;. I think I would prefer a single new option &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;:clone&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; which allows &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;:only&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;:exclude}} features as subspecifiers.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Convenience fn to unmap all names in a namespace?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw your "load/ns/require/use overhaul" ticket&lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;1&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; and would like to&lt;br/&gt;
ask for a few extra overhaulings. I have a project called retop, and&lt;br/&gt;
here is its file hiearachy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; tr/edu/bilkent/cs/retop.clj&lt;br/&gt;
 tr/edu/bilkent/cs/retop/km.clj&lt;br/&gt;
 tr/edu/bilkent/cs/retop/graph.clj&lt;br/&gt;
 tr/edu/bilkent/cs/retop/main.clj&lt;br/&gt;
 tr/edu/bilkent/cs/retop/util.clj&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In retop.clj, I have below ns definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (ns tr.edu.bilkent.cs.retop&lt;br/&gt;
   (:gen-class)&lt;br/&gt;
   (:import&lt;br/&gt;
    (com.sun.jna&lt;br/&gt;
     Function&lt;br/&gt;
     Pointer)&lt;br/&gt;
    (com.sun.jna.ptr&lt;br/&gt;
     IntByReference)&lt;br/&gt;
    (tr.edu.bilkent.cs.patoh&lt;br/&gt;
     HyperGraph&lt;br/&gt;
     HyperGraphException&lt;br/&gt;
     Parititoning&lt;br/&gt;
     ParititoningParameters))&lt;br/&gt;
   (:load&lt;br/&gt;
    "retop/util"&lt;br/&gt;
    "retop/km"&lt;br/&gt;
    "retop/graph"&lt;br/&gt;
    "retop/main"))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in every .clj file in retop/ directory I have below in-ns in the&lt;br/&gt;
very first line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (in-ns 'tr.edu.bilkent.cs.retop)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problems with the ns decleration are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Most of the :import's in retop.clj only belong to a single .clj file.&lt;br/&gt;
  For instance,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    (tr.edu.bilkent.cs.patoh&lt;br/&gt;
     HyperGraph&lt;br/&gt;
     HyperGraphException&lt;br/&gt;
     Parititoning&lt;br/&gt;
     ParititoningParameters)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  imports are only used by graph.clj. Yep, I can add an (import ...)&lt;br/&gt;
  line just after the (in-ns ...), but wouldn't it be better if I can&lt;br/&gt;
  specify that in (in-ns ...) form?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) See (:load ...) clause in (ns ...) form. There are lots of&lt;br/&gt;
  unnecessary directory prefixes. I'd be prefer something ala Common&lt;br/&gt;
  Lisp's defpackage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    (:load&lt;br/&gt;
     "packages"   ; packages.clj&lt;br/&gt;
     ("retop"&lt;br/&gt;
      "util"      ; retop/util.clj&lt;br/&gt;
      "km"        ; retop/km.clj&lt;br/&gt;
      "graph"     ; retop/graph.clj&lt;br/&gt;
      ("graph"&lt;br/&gt;
       "foo"      ; retop/graph/foo.clj&lt;br/&gt;
       "bar)      ; retop/graph/bar.clj&lt;br/&gt;
      "main"))    ; retop/main.clj&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  Also, being able to use wildcards would be awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) There are inconsistencies between macros and functions. For instance,&lt;br/&gt;
  consider:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    (ns foo.bar.baz (:use mov))&lt;br/&gt;
    (in-ns 'foo.bar.baz)&lt;br/&gt;
    (use 'mov)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  I'd like to get rid of quotations in both cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if I'm using the right tools and doing the right approach&lt;br/&gt;
for such a project. But if you agree with the above overhauling&lt;br/&gt;
requirements, I'd like to see them appear in the same assembla ticket as&lt;br/&gt;
well.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;1. If writing macros that do not evaluate their arguments, provide function versions that do evaluate their arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Do not support prefix lists for loading Clojure namespaces.  It's hard to parse with external tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Do not conflate importing Java classes with loading Clojure namespaces.  They are fundamentally different operations with different semantics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have implemented some ideas in a macro called "need" at &lt;a href="http://github.com/stuartsierra/need"&gt;http://github.com/stuartsierra/need&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;Permit tools to read the "ns" declaration and statically determine the dependencies of a namespace, without evaluating any code.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;This would be great for building OSGi bundles where Bnd is currently not  much help.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

	&lt;li&gt;What (small set of) steps will reproduce the problem?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;user&amp;gt; (def #^{:foo "bar"} x 5)&lt;br/&gt;
#'user/x&lt;br/&gt;
user&amp;gt; (meta #'x)&lt;br/&gt;
{:ns #&amp;lt;Namespace user&amp;gt;, :name x, :file "NO_SOURCE_FILE", :line 1, :foo "bar"}&lt;br/&gt;
user&amp;gt; (defn x [] 5)&lt;br/&gt;
#'user/x&lt;br/&gt;
user&amp;gt; (meta #'x)&lt;br/&gt;
{:ns #&amp;lt;Namespace user&amp;gt;, :name x, :file "NO_SOURCE_FILE", :line 1, :arglists ([])}&lt;br/&gt;
user&amp;gt; (meta x)&lt;br/&gt;
{:ns #&amp;lt;Namespace user&amp;gt;, :name x, :file "NO_SOURCE_FILE", :line 1, :foo "bar"}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What is the expected output? What do you see instead?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I expect (meta #'x) to evaluate to the value of the final (meta x) in the above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What version are you using?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Current master (commit 61202d2ff6925002400a9843e8fbd080f3bef3a5).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prompted by discussion at&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/6553d48c981019eb/3c55b0bd43a5d8e9?lnk=gst&amp;amp;q=off-by-one#3c55b0bd43a5d8e9"&gt;http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/6553d48c981019eb/3c55b0bd43a5d8e9?lnk=gst&amp;amp;q=off-by-one#3c55b0bd43a5d8e9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Initial attempt at a diagnosis:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think this is due to DefExpr's eval method binding the Var to init.eval() first and attaching the supplied metadata to the Var later &amp;#8211; see Compiler.java lines 341-352. (Note the Var is always already in place when init.eval() is called, regardless of whether it existed prior to the evaluation of the def / defn.) Thus the init expression supplied by defn sees the old (and wrong) metadata on the Var.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Another stab at diagnosis: The defn macro copies metadata from a var onto its new value, so if you defn a var that already exists, the old var metadata becomes metadata on the new value. I don't know why this would be the right thing to do, and if you eliminate this behavior (see patch) all the Clojure and Contrib tests still pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is correct, please assign back to me and I will write tests. If this is wrong, please tell me what's going on here so I know how to write the tests.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-259] clojure.lang.Reflector.invokeMatchingMethod is not complete (rejects pontentially valid method invocations)</title>

                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;There exists invoke expressions on instances, where Java is able to perform the call, yet clojure is not reflectively.&lt;br/&gt;
The problem is when the declaringClass of the found method is not public then the call to getAsMethodOfPublicBase uses the found method or searching for classes/interfaces that contain/define this method yet are declared publicly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This restricts the possible search space. I suggest that if target is not null (e.g. is not a static method), the target.getClass() should be used instead as a root for getAsMethodOfPublicBase.&lt;br/&gt;
This fixes my issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-250] debug builds</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-250</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;This ticket includes two patches: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;a patch to set  &lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;assert&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; when clojure.lang.RT loads, based on the presence of system property clojure.debug&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;expand error messages in assert to include &lt;tt&gt;local-bindings&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; (a new macro which wraps the implicit &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;&amp;amp;env&lt;/tt&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Things to consider before approving these patches:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;should there be an easy Clojure-level way to query if debug is enabled? (checking assert isn't the same, as debug should eventually drive other features)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;assertions will now be off by default &amp;#8211; this is a change!&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;is the addition of the name &lt;tt&gt;local-bindings&lt;/tt&gt; to clojure.core cool?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;RT will check system property &lt;tt&gt;"clojure.debug"&lt;/tt&gt;, default to false&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;property will set the root binding for the current &lt;tt&gt;&amp;#42;assert&amp;#42;&lt;/tt&gt;, plus a new &lt;tt&gt;&amp;#42;debug&amp;#42;&lt;/tt&gt; flag. (Debug builds can and will drive other things than just asserts.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;does Compile.java need to push &lt;tt&gt;&amp;#42;assert&amp;#42;&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;&amp;#42;debug&amp;#42;&lt;/tt&gt; as thread local bindings, or can they be root-bound only when compiling clojure?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;will add &lt;tt&gt;&amp;#42;debug&amp;#42;&lt;/tt&gt; binding to &lt;tt&gt;clojure.main/with-bindings&lt;/tt&gt;. Anywhere else?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;build.xml should not have to change &amp;#8211; system properties will flow through (and build.xml may not be around much longer anyway)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;once we agree on the approach, I will ping maven plugin and lein owners so that they flow the setting through&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;better assertion messages will be a separate ticket&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;what is the interaction between &amp;#42;debug&amp;#42; and &amp;#42;unchecked-math&amp;#42;? Change checks to &lt;tt&gt;(and &amp;#42;unchecked-math&amp;#42; (not &amp;#42;debug&amp;#42;))&lt;/tt&gt;}?&lt;/li&gt;

#4 - should &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; be in with-bindings for same reason as #3 - we don't want people to set! &amp;#42;debug&amp;#42; nor &amp;#42;assert&amp;#42;&lt;br/&gt;
#8 - yes, wrapping that in a helper fn&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#6 - my biggest reservation is that this isn't yet informed by maven best practices&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;However, I would prefer &lt;tt&gt;&amp;#42;assert&amp;#42;&lt;/tt&gt; to remain true by default.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="26015" author="cemerick" created="Thu, 9 Dec 2010 05:19:33 -0800">&lt;p&gt;SS is correct about this approach not posing any issue for Maven.  In addition, the build could easily be set up to always emit two jars, one "normal", one "debug".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd suggest that, while &lt;tt&gt;clojure.debug&lt;/tt&gt; might have broad effect, additional properties should be available to provide fine-grained control over each of the additional "debug"-related parameterizations that might become available in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd like to raise a couple of potentially tangential concerns (after now thinking about assertions for a bit in the above context), some or all of which may simply be a result of my lack of understanding in various areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at where &lt;tt&gt;assert&lt;/tt&gt; is used in &lt;tt&gt;core.clj&lt;/tt&gt; (only two places AFAICT: validating arguments to &lt;tt&gt;derive&lt;/tt&gt; and checking pre- and post-conditions in &lt;tt&gt;fn&lt;/tt&gt;), it would seem unwise to make it &lt;tt&gt;false&lt;/tt&gt; by default.  i.e. non-&lt;tt&gt;Named&lt;/tt&gt; values would be able to get into hierarchies, and pre- and post-conditions would simply be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's my understanding that assertions (talking here of the JVM construct, from which Clojure reuses &lt;tt&gt;AssertionError&lt;/tt&gt;) should not be used to validate arguments to public API functions, or used to validate any aspect of a function's normal operation (i.e. &lt;a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/guide/lang/assert.html#usage"&gt;"where not to use assertions"&lt;/a&gt;).  That would imply that &lt;tt&gt;derive&lt;/tt&gt; should throw &lt;tt&gt;IllegalArugmentException&lt;/tt&gt; when necessary, and fn pre- and post-conditions should perhaps throw &lt;tt&gt;IllegalStateException&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;#8211; or, in any case, something other than &lt;tt&gt;AssertionError&lt;/tt&gt; via &lt;tt&gt;assert&lt;/tt&gt;.  This would match up far better with most functions in core using &lt;tt&gt;assert-args&lt;/tt&gt; rather than &lt;tt&gt;assert&lt;/tt&gt;, the former throwing &lt;tt&gt;IllegalArgumentException&lt;/tt&gt; rather than &lt;tt&gt;AssertionError&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That leads me to the question: is &lt;tt&gt;assert&lt;/tt&gt; (and &lt;tt&gt;&amp;#42;assert&amp;#42;&lt;/tt&gt;) intended to be a Clojure construct, or a quasi-interop form?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the former, then it can roughly have whatever semantics we want, but then it seems like it should not be throwing &lt;tt&gt;AssertionError&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the latter, then &lt;tt&gt;AssertionError&lt;/tt&gt; is appropriate on the JVM, but then we need to take care that assertions can be enabled and disabled at runtime (without having to switch around different builds of Clojure), ideally using the host-defined switches (e.g. &lt;tt&gt;-ea&lt;/tt&gt; and friends) and likely not anything like &lt;tt&gt;&amp;#42;assert&amp;#42;&lt;/tt&gt;. I don't know if this is possible or practical at this point (I presume this would require nontrivial compiler changes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully the above is not water under the bridge at this point.  Thank you in advance for your forbearance. &lt;img class="emoticon" src="http://dev.clojure.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="26016" author="richhickey" created="Thu, 9 Dec 2010 06:08:07 -0800">&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the useful input Chas. Nothing is concluded yet. I think we should step back and look at the objective here, before moving forward with a solution. Being a dynamic language, there are many things we might want to validate about our programs, where the cost of checking is something we are unwilling to pay in production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a macro, assert has the nice property that, should &amp;#42;assert&amp;#42; not be true during compilation, it generates nil, no conditional test at all. Thus right now it is more like static conditional compilation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java assert does have runtime toggle-ability, via &amp;#45;ea as you say. I haven't looked at the bytecode generated for Java asserts, but it might be possible for Clojure assert to do something similar, if the runtime overhead is negligible. It is quite likely that HotSpot has special code for eliding the assertion bytecode given a single check of some flag. I'm just not sure that flag is &lt;a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html#desiredAssertionStatus()"&gt;Class.desiredAssertionStatus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether this turns into changes in assert or pre/post conditions, best practices etc is orthogonal and derived. Currently we don't have a facility to run without the checks. We need to choose between making them disappear during compilation (debug build) or runtime (track &amp;#45;ea) or both. Then we can look at how that is reflected in assert/pre-post and re-examine existing use of both. The "where not to use assertions" doc deals with them categorically, but in not considering their cost, seems unrealistic IMO. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd appreciate it if someone could look into how assert is generated and optimized by Java itself.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="26018" author="cemerick" created="Thu, 9 Dec 2010 15:04:52 -0800">&lt;p&gt;Bytecode issues continue to be above my pay grade, unfortunately…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few additional thoughts in response that you may or may not be juggling already:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;assert&lt;/tt&gt; being a macro makes total sense for what it's doing.  Trouble is, "compile-time" is a tricky concept in Clojure: there's code-loading-time, AOT-compile-time, and transitively-AOT-compile-time.  Given that, it's entirely possible for an application deployed to a production environment that contains a patchwork of code or no code produced by &lt;tt&gt;assert&lt;/tt&gt; usages in various libraries and namespaces depending upon when those libs and ns' were loaded, AOT-compiled, or their dependents AOT-compiled, and the value of &lt;tt&gt;&amp;#42;assert&amp;#42;&lt;/tt&gt; at each of those times.  Of course, this is the case for all such macros whose results are dependent upon context-dependent state (I think this was a big issue with &lt;tt&gt;clojure.contrib.logging&lt;/tt&gt;, making it only usable with log4j for a while).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's really attractive about the JVM assertion mechanism is that it can be parameterized for a given runtime on a per-package basis, if desired.  Reimplementing that concept so that &lt;tt&gt;assert&lt;/tt&gt; can be &lt;tt&gt;&amp;#42;ns&amp;#42;&lt;/tt&gt;-sensitive seems like it'd be straightforward, but the compile-time complexity already mentioned remains, and the idea of having two independently-controlled assertion facilities doesn't sound fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know nearly nothing about the CLR, but it would appear that it doesn't provide for anything like runtime-controllable assertions.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="26068" author="stu" created="Wed, 29 Dec 2010 13:17:44 -0800">&lt;p&gt;The best (dated) evidence I could find says that the compiler sets a special class static final field &lt;tt&gt;$assertionsDisabled&lt;/tt&gt; based on the return of &lt;tt&gt;desiredAssertionStatus&lt;/tt&gt;. HotSpot doesn't do anything special with this, dead code elimination simply makes it go away. The code indeed compiles this way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   11:	getstatic	#6; //Field $assertionsDisabled:Z&lt;br/&gt;
   14:	ifne	33&lt;br/&gt;
   17:	lload_1&lt;br/&gt;
   18:	lconst_0&lt;br/&gt;
   19:	lcmp&lt;br/&gt;
   20:	ifeq	33&lt;br/&gt;
   23:	new	#7; //class java/lang/AssertionError&lt;br/&gt;
   26:	dup&lt;br/&gt;
   27:	ldc	#8; //String X should be zero&lt;br/&gt;
   29:	invokespecial	#9; //Method java/lang/AssertionError."&amp;lt;init&amp;gt;":(Ljava/lang/Object;)V&lt;br/&gt;
   32:	athrow&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if we were 100% sure that assertion removal was total, I would still vote for a separate Clojure-level switch, for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I have a real and pressing need to disable some assertions, and I don't need the Java interop at all. Arguably others will be in the same boat.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;there will be multiple debugging facilities over time, and having a top-level &lt;b&gt;debug&lt;/b&gt; switch is convenient for Clojure users.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Java dis/enabling via command line flags is still possible as a separate feature. We could add this later as a (small) breaking change to our assert, or have a separate java-assert interop form. I am on the fence about which way to go here.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I believe it is perfectly fine to throw an &lt;tt&gt;AssertionError&lt;/tt&gt; from a non-Java-assertion-form. We don't believe in a world of a static exception hierarchy, and an assertion in production is a critical failure no matter what you call it. Even Scala does it &lt;img class="emoticon" src="http://dev.clojure.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/&gt; &lt;a href="http://daily-scala.blogspot.com/2010/03/assert-require-assume.html"&gt;http://daily-scala.blogspot.com/2010/03/assert-require-assume.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Yes, in static init code&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;There is no special support in the classloader, per Brian Goetz (private correspondence) last week. But dead code elimination is great: "The run-time cost of disabled assertions should indeed be zero for compiled code"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Currently we can have a subseq of a sorted-set|map-by, but this returns a seq and&lt;br/&gt;
not a Set or Map.&lt;br/&gt;
Implementing the interfaces java.util.SortedSet and java.util.SortedMap would give&lt;br/&gt;
us support for calling .subSet and .subMap.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-213] Invariants and the STM</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-213</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;(ticket requested here &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/119311e89fa46806/4903ce25ff6deaa6#4903ce25ff6deaa6"&gt;http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/119311e89fa46806/4903ce25ff6deaa6#4903ce25ff6deaa6&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general idea is to declare invariants inside a transaction and, when at commit time an invariant doesn't hold anymore, the transaction retries.&lt;br/&gt;
So it can both act as a kind of soft ensure or to specify actions that "partially commute".&lt;br/&gt;
Thus it would enable coarser refs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the attached file for quick prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User code would looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;(invariant (@world :key))
(commute world update-in [:key] val-transform-fn)&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means the commute will occur only if (@world :key) returns the same value in-transaction and at commit point.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-211] Support arbitrary functional destructuring via -&gt; and -&gt;&gt;</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-211</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Support arbitrary functional destructuring, that is the use of&lt;br/&gt;
any function in any destructuring form to help unpack data in&lt;br/&gt;
arbitrary ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion began here:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://clojure-log.n01se.net/date/2009-11-17.html#09:31c"&gt;http://clojure-log.n01se.net/date/2009-11-17.html#09:31c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attached patch implements the spec described here:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://clojure-log.n01se.net/date/2009-11-17.html#10:50a"&gt;http://clojure-log.n01se.net/date/2009-11-17.html#10:50a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That is, the following examples would now work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;user=&amp;gt; (let &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;(-&amp;gt; str a) 1&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; a)&lt;br/&gt;
"1"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;user=&amp;gt; (let [&lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;a (-&amp;gt; str b) c&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;1 2&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;] (list a b c))&lt;br/&gt;
(1 "2" nil)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;user=&amp;gt; (let [(-&amp;gt;&amp;gt; (map int) &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;a b&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;) "ab"] (list a b))&lt;br/&gt;
(97 98)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And if you've redefined -&amp;gt; or -&amp;gt;&amp;gt; to mean something else in your ns, do we need to catch that at compile time, or is it okay to emit the rearranged code and see what happens?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, would '#{&lt;del&gt;&amp;gt; -&amp;gt;&amp;gt; clojure.core/&lt;/del&gt;&amp;gt; clojure.core/-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;} be sufficient?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-200] Extend cond to support inline let, much like for</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-200</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;I find it occasionally very useful to do a few tests in a cond, then introduce some new symbols (for both clarity and efficiency) that can be referenced in later tests (or matching expressions).  This parallels similar functionality inside the for macro, where the :let keyword is matched against a vector of symbol bindings and forms an implicit let around the remainder of the comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll be adding a patch for this shortly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This has been true for a long time. Latest patch changes only the docstring of &lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;file&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; to accurately reflect current behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-190] enhance with-open to be extensible with a new close multimethod</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-190</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Discussion: &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/8e4e56f6fc65cc8e/618a893a5b2a5410"&gt;http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/8e4e56f6fc65cc8e/618a893a5b2a5410&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, with-open calls .close when it's finished.  I'd like it to have a (defmulti close type) so it's behavior is extensible.  A standard method could be defined for java.io.Closeable and a :default method with no type hint.  I've come across a few cases where some external library defines what is essentially a close method but names it shutdown or disable, etc., and adding my own "defmethod close" would be much easier than rewriting with-open.  This would also allow people to eliminate reflection for classes like sql Connection that were created before Closeable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Somehow I just forgot to define parameters for my zero argument function and it took me a long time to notice it, mostly because I had been working with a lot of macros but especially because I didn't get an error that said "You must provide a list of parameter names", but instead: "Don't know how to create ISeq from: Symbol".&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <comment id="26761" author="stuart.sierra" created="Sun, 4 Sep 2011 23:38:00 -0700">&lt;p&gt;This is an easy mistake to make - I do it myself quite often. Better error messages for this common case would be good for new users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-157" title="Need better error report when omitting parameter list from (fn) or (defn)"&gt;CLJ-157&lt;/a&gt; could probably be subsumed into a more general patch improving error messages about the expected arguments to &lt;tt&gt;fn&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;defn&lt;/tt&gt; is a macro which expands to &lt;tt&gt;fn&lt;/tt&gt;, so a patch to &lt;tt&gt;fn&lt;/tt&gt; should fix both.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="26767" author="ambrosebs" created="Mon, 5 Sep 2011 21:43:04 -0700">&lt;p&gt;I'm working a patch for this.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="26772" author="ambrosebs" created="Wed, 7 Sep 2011 05:31:22 -0700">&lt;p&gt;Is it ok to break the behavior of these two cases?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(fn a)&lt;br/&gt;
(fn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far I am throwing an error "Parameter list missing" instead of silently returning a function with AFAICT undefined behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="26778" author="ambrosebs" created="Fri, 9 Sep 2011 03:23:44 -0700">&lt;p&gt;I've attached a patch. There are some breaking changes for undefined behavior, I have detailed them in the commit message.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="26917" author="stu" created="Mon, 10 Oct 2011 05:10:05 -0700">&lt;p&gt;The trickiest thing with this kind of error reporting is guessing what the programmer was trying to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greater the probability a random string is a valid program, the harder it is to report errors well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8211; &lt;a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/redund.html"&gt;http://www.paulgraham.com/redund.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
An example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="preformattedContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;(defn add (a b) (+ a b))
IllegalArgumentException Parameter declaration a should be a vector  clojure.core/assert-valid-fdecl
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the error message is based on a guess that I was trying to use the multi-arity syntax, but I was probably using the single-arity syntax with the wrong brackets. You might split these cases out by counting the top-level forms first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I am cool with the change to &lt;tt&gt;(fn)&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;(fn a)&lt;/tt&gt;, but I can imagine a code generator relying on this behavior as a sentinel to avoid explicit coding for a corner case. What do others think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One small thing in the code. Why the redundant boolean work here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="preformattedContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;(if (instance? clojure.lang.Symbol name) false true)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="26918" author="ambrosebs" created="Mon, 10 Oct 2011 05:48:33 -0700">&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;(&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (instance? clojure.lang.Symbol name) &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's so early in the bootstrap that both `not` and `symbol?` are not defined. That line is in the definition of `defn`. I added a comment documenting this.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="26919" author="trptcolin" created="Mon, 10 Oct 2011 07:19:49 -0700">&lt;p&gt;I run into this all the time too - thanks for doing this, Ambrose!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stuart's example is an interesting one - that could have meant at least one other thing in addition to multi-arity syntax and single-arity syntax with accidentally-list params: single-arity syntax with missing param list, and two successive body forms (where a and b are free variables). I think the error message here would still be an improvement over "Don't know how to create ISeq from: Symbol", but maybe it tries to be too specific in talking about "a". I'd tend toward being more generic and just saying "Parameter declaration should be a vector", which I think would be helpful and correct in all the intended cases we've imagined for this particular example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think breaking (fn) / (fn a) makes sense - if there's a valid use for those I'd be interested in seeing it. Relying on ArityException in code generation seems fairly error-prone to me, but I could easily be missing something here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the boolean point, I tend to agree with Stuart and would prefer reversing the if/else clauses to avoid it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-none"&gt;(if (instance? clojure.lang.Symbol name)
  nil      
  (throw (IllegalArgumentException. "First argument to defn must be a symbol")))&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</comment>

                    <comment id="27349" author="carinmeier" created="Sun, 27 Nov 2011 12:54:27 -0800">&lt;p&gt;I checked out the changes and tried it out successfully.  I think it is a great improvement.  My only comment is regarding the text of the error message for &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="preformattedContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;user=&amp;gt; (defn [x])
IllegalArgumentException First argument to defn must be a symbol  clojure.core/defn (core.clj:273)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be helpful to newcomers to mention that the parameter is the name.  Something like, "Name argument to defn must be a symbol".&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

            <title>[CLJ-153] Suggest adding set-precision! API to accompany with-precision</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-153</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ticket #137 makes &lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;math-context&lt;/b&gt;&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; settable at the REPL. However, &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;&lt;b&gt;math-context&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is not a public name in Clojure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The related public function is &lt;tt&gt;with-precision&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; which works by pushing a new binding for &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;&lt;b&gt;math-context&lt;/b&gt;&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;. This ticket suggests adding &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;set-precision!&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; to Clojure's public API. Its effect would be the same as &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;with-precision&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;, but accomplished by using &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;set!&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; on the current &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;&lt;b&gt;math-context&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; binding rather than by pushing a new binding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chouser suggests that we also add a doc string for &lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;math-context&lt;/b&gt;&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; noting that it is private and pointing the user to &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;with-precision&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;set-precision!&lt;/tt&gt;. I agree.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-148] Poor reporting of symbol conflicts when using (ns)</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-148</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a module that includes pprint and my own utils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When com.howard.lewisship.cascade.dom/write was changed from private to public I get the following error:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;java.lang.IllegalStateException: write already refers to: #'clojure.contrib.pprint/write in namespace: com.howardlewisship.cascade.test-views (test_views.clj:0)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(ns com.howardlewisship.cascade.test-views ; line 15&lt;br/&gt;
  (:use&lt;br/&gt;
   (clojure.contrib test-is pprint duck-streams)&lt;br/&gt;
   (app1 views fragments)&lt;br/&gt;
   (com.howardlewisship.cascade config dom view-manager)&lt;br/&gt;
   com.howardlewisship.cascade.internal.utils))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That line number is wrong but better yet, identifying the true conflict (com.howard.lewisship.cascade.dom/write) would be even more important.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <comment id="22991" author="importer" created="Tue, 24 Aug 2010 01:54:00 -0700">&lt;p&gt;scgilardi said: It's saying that the symbol com.howardlewisship.cascade.test-views/write already resolves to #���clojure.contrib.pprint/write, so you can't def a new write in com.howardlewisship.cascade.test-views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you propose for an alternate wording of the error message here?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="26430" author="rosejn" created="Thu, 12 May 2011 07:49:03 -0700">&lt;p&gt;I think the issue is that only one side of the conflict is reported in the error, so if you get this kind of error in the middle of a large project it can be hard to figure out which namespace is conflicting.  Take a toy example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;user=&amp;gt; (ns foo)&lt;br/&gt;
foo=&amp;gt; (def foobar 42)&lt;br/&gt;
foo=&amp;gt; (ns bar)&lt;br/&gt;
bar=&amp;gt; (def foobar 0)&lt;br/&gt;
bar=&amp;gt; (ns problem)&lt;br/&gt;
problem=&amp;gt; (refer 'foo)&lt;br/&gt;
problem=&amp;gt; (refer 'bar)&lt;br/&gt;
java.lang.IllegalStateException: foobar already refers to: #'foo/foobar in namespace: problem (NO_SOURCE_FILE:0)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case it would be best if the error said something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Conflict referring to #'bar/foobar in #&amp;lt;Namespace problem&amp;gt; because foobar already refers to: #'foo/foobar."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way the error message clearly identifies the location of the conflict, and the locations of the two conflicting vars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this helps clarify.  I think I see where to fix it in warnOrFailOnReplace on line 88 of src/jvm/clojure/lang/Namespace.java, and this reminds me I need to send in a CA so I can pitch in next time...&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;The value of a Var can be operated on directly, or, if it is a fn, it can be invoked and the resulting value operated on.  :tag metadata on a Var is used to provide a type hint to the compiler to avoid reflection.  Having a single metadata key for this two distinct uses makes it possible (even easy, if unlikely) to create a situation where type-hinting the value causes a ClassCastException on an operation on the invocation return value, or the reverse.  The only obvious solution is two use different keys for the two uses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-130] Namespace metadata lost in AOT compile</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-130</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;For example, the namespace @clojure.contrib.def@ has metadata for doc and author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see this when we load the file directly from source:&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 tom@goya:~/src/clj$ java -cp clojure/clojure.jar:clojure-contrib/src clojure.lang.Repl&lt;br/&gt;
 Clojure 1.1.0-alpha-SNAPSHOT&lt;br/&gt;
 user=&amp;gt; (load "clojure/contrib/def")&lt;br/&gt;
 nil&lt;br/&gt;
 user=&amp;gt; (find-ns 'clojure.contrib.def)     &lt;br/&gt;
 #&amp;lt;Namespace clojure.contrib.def&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 user=&amp;gt; ^(find-ns 'clojure.contrib.def)&lt;br/&gt;
 {:author "Stephen C. Gilardi", :doc "def.clj provides variants of def that make including doc strings and\nmaking private definitions more succinct."}&lt;br/&gt;
 user=&amp;gt; &lt;br/&gt;
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if we load the file from the jar where it's been compiled, the metadata is lost:&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 tom@goya:~/src/clj$ java -cp clojure/clojure.jar:clojure-contrib/clojure-contrib.jar clojure.lang.Repl&lt;br/&gt;
 Clojure 1.1.0-alpha-SNAPSHOT&lt;br/&gt;
 user=&amp;gt; (use 'clojure.contrib.def)&lt;br/&gt;
 nil&lt;br/&gt;
 user=&amp;gt; (find-ns 'clojure.contrib.def)&lt;br/&gt;
 #&amp;lt;Namespace clojure.contrib.def&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 user=&amp;gt; ^(find-ns 'clojure.contrib.def)&lt;br/&gt;
 nil&lt;br/&gt;
 user=&amp;gt; &lt;br/&gt;
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if we use @load@, we don't see metadata on the item:&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 tom@goya:~/src/clj$ java -cp clojure/clojure.jar:clojure-contrib/clojure-contrib.jar clojure.lang.Repl&lt;br/&gt;
 Clojure 1.1.0-alpha-SNAPSHOT&lt;br/&gt;
 user=&amp;gt; (load "clojure/contrib/def")&lt;br/&gt;
 nil&lt;br/&gt;
 user=&amp;gt; (find-ns 'clojure.contrib.def)&lt;br/&gt;
 #&amp;lt;Namespace clojure.contrib.def&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 user=&amp;gt; ^(find-ns 'clojure.contrib.def)&lt;br/&gt;
 nil&lt;br/&gt;
 user=&amp;gt; &lt;br/&gt;
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The jar isn't the problem, for if we use the slim jar (without the AOT&lt;br/&gt;
class files), we see that the metadata is fine: &lt;br/&gt;
&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 tom@goya:~/src/clj$ java -cp clojure/clojure.jar:clojure-contrib/clojure-contrib-slim.jar clojure.lang.Repl&lt;br/&gt;
 Clojure 1.1.0-alpha-SNAPSHOT&lt;br/&gt;
 user=&amp;gt; (use 'clojure.contrib.def)&lt;br/&gt;
 nil&lt;br/&gt;
 user=&amp;gt; (find-ns 'clojure.contrib.def)&lt;br/&gt;
 #&amp;lt;Namespace clojure.contrib.def&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 user=&amp;gt; ^(find-ns 'clojure.contrib.def)&lt;br/&gt;
 {:author "Stephen C. Gilardi", :doc "def.clj provides variants of def that make including doc strings and\nmaking private definitions more succinct."}&lt;br/&gt;
 user=&amp;gt; &lt;br/&gt;
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems to be true usually, but not always. For example the&lt;br/&gt;
metadata on the pretty print namespace is just fine from the AOT version:&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 tom@goya:~/src/clj$ java -cp clojure/clojure.jar:clojure-contrib/clojure-contrib.jar clojure.lang.Repl&lt;br/&gt;
 Clojure 1.1.0-alpha-SNAPSHOT&lt;br/&gt;
 user=&amp;gt; (use 'clojure.contrib.pprint)&lt;br/&gt;
 nil&lt;br/&gt;
 user=&amp;gt; (find-ns 'clojure.contrib.pprint)&lt;br/&gt;
 #&amp;lt;Namespace clojure.contrib.pprint&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 user=&amp;gt; ^(find-ns 'clojure.contrib.pprint)&lt;br/&gt;
 {:author "Tom Faulhaber", :doc "This module comprises two elements:\n1) A pretty printer for Clojure data structures, implemented in the function \"pprint\"\n2) A Common Lisp compatible format function, implemented as \"cl-format\" because\n   Clojure is using the name \"format\" for its own format.\n\nComplete documentation is available on the wiki at the contrib google code site.", :see-also [&lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;&amp;quot;PrettyPrinting&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Documentation for the pretty printer&amp;quot;&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;&amp;quot;CommonLispFormat&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Documentation for Common Lisp format function&amp;quot;&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;]}&lt;br/&gt;

            <title>[CLJ-129] Add documentation to sorted-set-by detailing how the provided comparator may change set membership semantics</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-129</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;To start, let's look at some simple default sorted-set behaviour (which uses PersistentHashMap via PersistentHashSet, and therefore uses equality/hashCode to determine identity):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;user=&amp;gt; (sorted-set [1 2] [-5 10] [1 5])
#{[-5 10] [1 2] [1 5]}
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

sorted-set-by uses PersistentTreeMap via PersistentTreeSet though, which implies that the comparator provided to sorted-set-by will be used to determine identity, and therefore member in the set.  This can lead to (IMO) non-intuitive behaviour:

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;
user=&amp;gt; (sorted-set-by #(&amp;gt; (first %) (first %2)) [1 2] [-5 10] [1 5])
#{[1 2] [-5 10]}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that because the provided comparison fn determines that &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;1 2&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;1 5&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; have the same sort order, the latter value is considered identical to the former, and not included in the set.  This behaviour could be very handy, but is also likely to cause confusion when what the user almost certainly wants is to maintain the membership semantics of the original set (e.g. relying upon equality/hashCode), but only modify the ordering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(BTW, yes, I know there's far easier ways to get the order I'm indicating above over a set of vectors thanks to vectors being comparable via the compare fn.  The examples are only meant to be illustrative.  The same non-intuitive result would occur, with no easy fallback (like the 'compare' fn when working with vectors) when the members of the set are non-Comparable Java object, and the comparator provided to sorted-set-by is defining a sort over some values returned by method calls into those objects.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd be happy to change the docs for sorted-set-by, but I suspect that there are others who could encapsulate what's going on here more correctly and more concisely than I.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-127] DynamicClassLoader's call to ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader is prohibited in some environments</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-127</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;Currently, clojure.lang.DynamicClassLoader's constructor has the&lt;br/&gt;
following call to super():&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;(EMPTY_URLS,
      (&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;Thread&lt;/span&gt;.currentThread().getContextClassLoader() == &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt; ||
        &lt;span class="code-object"&gt;Thread&lt;/span&gt;.currentThread().getContextClassLoader() == &lt;span class="code-object"&gt;ClassLoader&lt;/span&gt;.getSystemClassLoader()) ?
          &lt;span class="code-object"&gt;Compiler&lt;/span&gt;.class.getClassLoader() : &lt;span class="code-object"&gt;Thread&lt;/span&gt;.currentThread().getContextClassLoader());&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That call to ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader() is forbidden by Google&lt;br/&gt;
AppEngine's security policies. That restricts you from being able to&lt;br/&gt;
load any resources from the classpath that haven't been AOT-compiled.&lt;br/&gt;
I've verified that just removing that removing the " ||&lt;br/&gt;
Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader() ==&lt;br/&gt;
ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader()" does in fact result in something&lt;br/&gt;
that works in GAE (as far as my needs go). Unfortunately, I'm not sure&lt;br/&gt;
whether that breaks anything, which, presumably, it does.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-126] abstract superclass with non-public accessibility</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-126</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;The following code works in Java 6 but not in Java 5:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(def Clojure 1.1.0-alpha-SNAPSHOT&lt;br/&gt;
user=&amp;gt; (def s (new StringBuilder "aaa"))&lt;br/&gt;
#'user/s&lt;br/&gt;
user=&amp;gt; (. s setCharAt (int 0) (char \a))&lt;br/&gt;
java.lang.Exception: Unable to resolve symbol: setCharAt in this context&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was discussed on the Clojure mailing list and Stephen C. Gillardi came up with the following conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_StringBuilder extends AbstractStringBuilder (though the JavaDoc docs lie and say it extends Object). AbstractStringBuilder has default accessibility (not public, protected, or private) which makes the class inaccessible to code outside the java.lang package. In both Java SE 5 and Java SE 6, StringBuilder does not contain a .setCharAt method definition. It relies on the inherited public method in AbstractStringBuilder. (I downloaded the source code for both versions from Sun to check.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Java SE 5, when Clojure checks whether or not .setCharAt on StringBuilder is public, it finds that it's a public method of a non-public base class and throws the exception you saw. (It looks like you're using a version of Clojure older than 18 May 2009 (Clojure svn r1371). Versions later than that print the more detailed message I saw.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Java SE 6, Clojure's checks for accessibility of this method succeed and the method call works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure whether or not Clojure could be modified to make this method call work in Java 5. Google searches turn up discussion that this pattern of using an undocumented abstract superclass with non-public accessibility is not common in the JDK._ &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ticket is being filed in the event that Clojure can handle these types of situations somehow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>[CLJ-124] GC  Issue 120: Determine mechanism for controlling automatic shutdown of Agents, with a default policy and mechanism for changing that policy as needed</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-124</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;Reported by cemer...@snowtide.com, Jun 01, 2009

There has been intermittent chatter over the past months from a couple of
people on the group (e.g.
http:&lt;span class="code-comment"&gt;//groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/409054e3542adc1f)
&lt;/span&gt;and in #clojure about some clojure scripts hanging, either &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; a constant
time (usually reported as a minute or so with no CPU util) or seemingly
forever (or until someone kills the process).

I just hit a similar situation in our compilation process, which invokes
clojure.lang.Compile from ant.  The build process &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; particular
project had taken 15 second or so, but after adding a couple of pmap calls,
that build time jumped to ~1:15, with roughly zero CPU utilization over the
course of that last minute.

Adding a call to Agent.shutdown() in the &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;finally&lt;/span&gt; block in
clojure.lang.Compile/main resolved the problem; a patch including &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;
change is attached.  I wouldn't suspect anyone would have any issues with
such a change.

-----
In general, it doesn't seem like everyone should keep tripping over &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;
problem in different directions.  It's a very difficult thing to debug &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;
you're not attuned to how clojure's concurrency primitives work under the
hood, and I would bet that newer users would be particularly affected.

After discussion in #clojure, rhickey suggested adding a
*auto-shutdown-agents* &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;, which:

- &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; when exiting one of the main entry points (clojure.main, or the
legacy script/repl entry points), Agent.shutdown() would be called,
allowing &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; the clean exit of the application

- would be bound by &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;

- could be easily set to &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; anyone with an advanced use-&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; that
requires agents to remain active after the main thread of the application
exits.

This would obviously not help anyone initializing clojure from a different
entry point, but &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; may represent the best compromise between
least-surprise and maximal functionality &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; advanced users.

------

In addition to the above, it perhaps might be worthwhile to change the
keepalive values used to create the Threadpools used by c.l.Actor's
Executors.  Currently, Actor uses a &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; thread pool executor, which
results in a 60s keepalive.  Lowering &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; to something much smaller (1s?
5s?) would additionally minimize the impact of Agent's threadpools on Java
applications that embed clojure directly (and would therefore not benefit
from *auto-shutdown-agents* as currently conceived, leading to puzzling
'hanging' behaviour).  I'm not in a position to determine what impact &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;
would have on performance due to thread churn, but it would at least
minimize what would be perceived as undesirable behaviour by users that are
less familiar with the implementation details of Agent and code that
depends on it.

Comment 1  by cemer...@snowtide.com, Jun 01, 2009

Just FYI, I'd be happy to provide patches &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; either of the suggestions mentioned
above...&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Java 1.5.0_19&lt;br/&gt;
Java 1.6.0_13&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, when building clojure using "ant" from within my clone of the clojure repo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;java&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; java.security.AccessControlException: access denied (java.lang.RuntimePermission modifyThread)&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reproduced this on two Mac OS X 10.5 machines. I'm not aware of having any enhanced security policies along these lines on my machines. The compile goes fine for me with Java 1.6.0_0 on an Ubuntu box.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;See the note for "permissions" on &lt;a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/CoreTasks/java.html"&gt;http://ant.apache.org/manual/CoreTasks/java.html&lt;/a&gt; .  I assume ThreadPoolExecutor.shutdown is the problem, it would shutdown the main Ant thread, so Ant disallows that.  Forking avoids the permissions limitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, since the build error still resulted in "BUILD SUCCESSFUL", I think failonerror="true" should also be added to the java call so the build would totally fail for such an error.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

There are already well-defined and intuitive ways to block on agents and futures. Why not deprecate shutdown-agents and force users to call await and deref if they really want to block? In the pmap situation one would have to evaluate the pmap form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The System.exit problem goes away if you configure the threadpools to use daemon threads (call new ThreadPoolExecutor and pass a thread factory that creates threads and sets daemon to true). That way the user has an explicit means of blocking and System.exit won't hang.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;I think that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;agent thread pool threads should be named (see ticket &lt;a href="https://www.assembla.com/spaces/clojure/tickets/378-set-thread-names-on-agent-thread-pools"&gt;#378&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;agent thread pools must be daemon threads by default&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;having ways to specify an customized executor pool for an agent send/send-off is essential to customize threading behavior&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;(shutdown-agents) should be either deprecated or made less dangerous&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is because daemon threads could terminate before their work is complete, would it be acceptable to &lt;a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/Runtime.html#addShutdownHook(java.lang.Thread)"&gt;add a shutdown hook&lt;/a&gt; to ensure against such premature termination?  Such a shutdown hook could call &lt;tt&gt;Agent.shutdown()&lt;/tt&gt;, then &lt;a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorService.html#awaitTermination(long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)"&gt;&lt;tt&gt;awaitTermination()&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the pools.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

The version.properties in the 1.0 branch generates snapshot releases.
Ideally, there should be a tags/1.0 branch that locks down the 1.0 release.
Context: trying to build a 1.0 release artifact &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; the Maven repository.

Comment 1 by richhickey, May 04, 2009

Do you believe &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; advice was erroneous?

&lt;/span&gt;
Comment 2 by hlship, May 05, 2009

I'm bothered that the 1.0 release is a 1.0 release, but not really.  Either its a
&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; release or its not. Saying its still a snapshot when you've broadcasted to the
world that its &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; seems very odd to me.

On the mailing list, I espoused the &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"Apache Way"&lt;/span&gt;, which is to not get hung up on a
&lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"1.0.0"&lt;/span&gt; number, but keep releasing.  If &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"1.0.2"&lt;/span&gt; has bugs, fix them and release
&lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"1.0.3"&lt;/span&gt;.  If that is &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;finally&lt;/span&gt; stable, announce &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"Clojure 1.0 is version 1.0.3"&lt;/span&gt;. Let the
release prove itself valid.

Older Tapestry releases were based on the &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"line in the sand"&lt;/span&gt; approach ... and always
ended up requiring a flurry of dot release bug fixes.&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;Reported by bo...@boriska.com, Apr 28, 2009

Currently there is no way to access anonymous array parameter of areduce.

Consider:

(areduce (.. &lt;span class="code-object"&gt;System&lt;/span&gt; getProperties values toArray) 
     i r 0 (some_expression))
some_expression has no way to access the array.

Per Rich:
--------------------
Yes, areduce would be nicer &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; it looked like a binding set:

(areduce [aname anarray, ret init] expr)
(areduce [aname anarray, ret init, start-idx  start-n] expr)
(areduce [aname anarray, ret init, start-idx  start-n, end-idx end-n]
expr) 
--------------------

This was discussed here:

What (small set of) steps will reproduce the problem?

&lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"require"&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"use"&lt;/span&gt; support a &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;":reload-all"&lt;/span&gt; flag that is intended to  
cause the specified libs to be reloaded along with all libs on which  
they directly or indirectly depend. This is implemented by temporarily  
binding a &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"loaded-libs"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; to the empty set and then loading the  
specified libs.

AOT compilation added another &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"already loaded"&lt;/span&gt; mechanism to  
clojure.lang.RT.load() which is currently not sensitive to a "reload-
all" being in progress and breaks its operation in the following &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt;:

        A, B, and C are libs
        A depends on B. (via :require in its ns form)
        B depends on C. (via :require in its ns form)
        B has been compiled (B.class is on classpath)

        At the repl I &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"require"&lt;/span&gt; A which loads A, B, and C (either from
class files or clj files)
        I modify C.clj
        At the repl I &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"require"&lt;/span&gt; A with the :reload-all flag, intending to  
pick up the changes to C
        C is not reloaded because RT.load() skips loading B: B.class
exists, is already loaded, and B.clj hasn't changed since it was compiled.


What is the expected output? What &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; you see instead?

I expect :reload-all to be effective. It isn't.

What version are you using?

svn 1354, 1.0.0RC1

Was &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; discussed on the group? If so, please provide a link to the
discussion:

http:&lt;span class="code-comment"&gt;//groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_frm/thread/9bbc290321fd895f/e6a967250021462a#e6a967250021462a
&lt;/span&gt;
Please provide any additional information below.

I'll upload a patch soon that creates a &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"*reload-all*"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; with a  
root binding of nil and code to bind it to &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; when the current  
thread has a :reload-all call pending. When *reload-all* is &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;,  
RT.load() will (re)load all libs from their &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;".clj"&lt;/span&gt; files even &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;  
they're already loaded.

The fix &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; may need to be coordinated with a fix &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; issue #3.&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

rhickey: unlink: then just use a map {:escaped &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; :val &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"foo"&lt;/span&gt;}

unlink: What I meant is, everything in between would want to see something 
&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;-y, not caring whether it's a &lt;span class="code-object"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; or MyString.

hiredman: unlink: &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; you use something that &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; CharSequence and 
IMeta (I think it's IMeta) you get something that is basically a &lt;span class="code-object"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;, 
but with metadata

rhickey: what hiredman said

hiredman: ideally most things would not specify &lt;span class="code-object"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; but CharSequence in 
their &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt;

hiredman: but somehow I doubt that is &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt;

unlink: ok.

unlink: Good to know.

rhickey: hiredman: unfortunately that's not &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; of some of Clojure - could 
you enter an issue &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; it please - use CharSequence when possible?&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;Reported by a...@thened.net, Apr 08, 2009

I posted &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; small patch to the mailing list last week but received no
feedback, so I'm attaching it here to make sure it doesn't get lost.  I
have submitted a CA.

http:&lt;span class="code-comment"&gt;//groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/4345f76a12bac6fe/
&lt;/span&gt;
The &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; function bit-count returns the count of 1-bits in a number, like
C's popcount or Common Lisp's logcount.&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;Reported by rosejn, Mar 19, 2009

Example:
user=&amp;gt; (&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;-let [foo (+ 1 2)] foo + 1 foo)
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;-let requires a vector &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; its
binding (NO_SOURCE_FILE:2)

The error reports that &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;-let requires a vector &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; its binding, but the
problem here has nothing to &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; with the binding being a vector.  A paren
was forgotten before the '+', so the number of arguments is incorrect &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;
the &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; form.&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;clj-103-incorrect-if-let-error-patch2.txt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;applies cleanly and doesn't cause any problems. I don't like the wording of the error message: "requires 1 or 2 forms to be passed" so I added another patch&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;clj-103-improved-if-let-error-message-patch.txt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which is the same change but with the wording "requires 1 or 2 forms after binding vector" which I think is a little more clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;Reported by H.Duerer, Mar 13, 2009

max-key or min-key will evaluate (k value) multiple times &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; arguments &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;
more than 2 arguments are passed.

This is undesirable &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; k is expensive to calculate.

Something like the code below would avoid these &lt;span class="code-object"&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; calculations (at the
price of generating more ephemeral garbage)

(defn max-key
  &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"Returns the x &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; which (k x), a number, is greatest."&lt;/span&gt;
  ([k x] x)
  ([k x y] (&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (&amp;gt; (k x) (k y)) x y))
  ([k x y &amp;amp; more]
     (second (reduce (fn [x y] (&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (&amp;gt; (first x) (first y)) x y))
                     (map #(vector (k %) %) (cons x (cons y more)))))))&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;Reported by davidhaub, Feb 14, 2009

When attempting to compile the following program, clojure fails with a
ClassNotFoundException.  It occurs because one of the methods returns the
same class that is being generated.  If the returnMe method below is
changed to &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; an &lt;span class="code-object"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;, the compile succeeds.

Beware when testing! If the classpath contains a class file (say from a
prior successful build when the returnMe method was changed to &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; an
object), the compile will succeed.  Always clear out the
clojure.compile.path prior to compiling.

;badgenclass.clj
(ns badgenclass
  (:gen-class
     :state state
     :methods
     [[returnMe [] badgenclass]]
     :init init))
(defn -init []
  [[] nil])

(defn -returnMe [&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;]
  &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;)

#!/bin/sh
rm -rf classes
mkdir classes
java -cp lib/clojure.jar:classes:. -Dclojure.compile.path=classes \
clojure.lang.Compile badgenclass


Comment 1 by chouser, Mar 07, 2009

Attached is a patch that accepts strings or symbols &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; parameter and &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; class
names, and generates the appropriate bytecode without calling &lt;span class="code-object"&gt;Class&lt;/span&gt;/forName.  It
fixes &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; issue, but because 'ns' doesn't resolve :gen-class's arguments, class
names aren't checked as early anymore.  :gen-class-created classes with invalid
parameter or &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; types can even be instantiated, and no error will be reported
until the broken method is called.

One possible alternative would be to call &lt;span class="code-object"&gt;Class&lt;/span&gt;/forName on any symbols given, but
allow strings to use the method given by &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; patch.  To &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; your own type, you'd
need a method defined like:

  [returnMe [] &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"badgenclass"&lt;/span&gt;]

Any thoughts?&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

I think the proposed (but not implemented) use of string/symbol to control when class names are resolved is a bad idea: magical and not implied by the types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

            <title>[CLJ-77] GC Issue 74:    Clojure compiler emits too-large classfiles (results in ClassFormatError)</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-77</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;Reported by cemer...@snowtide.com, Feb 10, 2009

The jvm has certain implementation limits around the maximum size of
classfiles, literal strings, method length, etc; however, in certain
circumstances, the Clojure compiler can currently emit classfiles that
violate some of those limitations, causing an error later when the
classfile is loaded.

While test coverage would necessarily detect &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; sort of problem on a
project-by-project basis when one's tests attempted to load a project's
classfiles, it seems like Clojure should &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; the following to ensure failure
as quickly as possible:

- &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; an exception immediately &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; compiling a lib, it is detected
that the resulting classfile(s) would violate any classfile implementation
limits.  Ideally, the exception's message would detail what file and on
which line number the offending form is (e.g. &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; a method's bytecode would
be too &lt;span class="code-object"&gt;long&lt;/span&gt;).  I can imagine that doing &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; may not be straightforward; a
reasonable stop-gap would be &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; the compiler to immediately attempt to
load the generated classfile in order to ensure up-front failure.

- emit a warning &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; any clojure form is read that would, upon being
compiled, require violating any of the classfile implementation limits; I
suspect that *most* people looking to generate classfiles would be doing so
in a &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"build"&lt;/span&gt; environment (rather than loading some code, tinkering, and
then using clojure.core/compile), but &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; those that aren't, I can imagine
there being a good deal of frustration around seeing that loading and using
some code successfully would eventually produce unusable classfiles.

I've appended a sample stack trace emitted by java when it attempted to
load a too-&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;long&lt;/span&gt; method implementation (which was produced by embedding a
large list literal in a compiled lib).

                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-69</link>

                        <description>&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;Reported by wolfe.a.jason, Feb 04, 2009

Describe the feature/change.

Add &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"keyset"&lt;/span&gt; to Clojure; make .keySet &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; APersistentMap &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; an
IPersistentSet

Was &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; discussed on the group? If so, please provide a link to the
discussion:

http:&lt;span class="code-comment"&gt;//groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/66e708e477ae992f/ff3d8d588068b60e?hl=en#ff3d8d588068b60e
&lt;/span&gt;
-----------------------------------------------------

A patch is attached.  Some notes:

I chose to add a &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"keyset"&lt;/span&gt; function, rather than change the existing &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"keys"&lt;/span&gt;,
so as to avoid breaking anything.

The corresponding RT.keyset function just calls .keySet on the argument.
I would have liked to have &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"keyset"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; an IPersistentSet even when
passed a (non-Clojure) java.util.Map, but &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; seems impossible to &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; in
sublinear time because of essentially the same limitation mentioned in the
above thread (the Map &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; does not support getKey() or entryAt()) --
assuming, again, that &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"get"&lt;/span&gt; is supposed to &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; the actual (identical?)
key in a set, and not just an .equal key.

I then changed the implementation of .keySet &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; APersistentMap to
essentially copy APersistentSet.  A more concise alternative would have
been to extend APersistentSet and override the .get method, but that made
me a bit nervous (since &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; APeristentSet changed &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; could &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;). 

Anyway, &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; is my first patch &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; the Java side of Clojure, and I'm not
yet solid on the conventions and aesthetics, so
comments/questions/criticisms/requests &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; revisions are very welcome.&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

I mentioned &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; on Google Groups.

Currently the core Clojure datatypes are not Java Serializable.  This means
that they cannot easily be streamed as binary objects.  Also, it will be
difficult to use them with certain Java features like RMI.

Comment 1 by rob.nikander, Mar 11, 2009

I voted &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; because I'm experimenting with using Clojure &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; web apps.  Tomcat barfs trying to serialize 
objects in the session, like clojure.lang.Cons.

I'm experimenting with Clojure and Wicket.  Any Wicket page classes containing maps
that use Keywords as keys can't be saved to the session because Keyword isn't
serializable.&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;Reported by Levente.Santha, Jan 11, 2009
The bug was described in detail in &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; thread: http:&lt;span class="code-comment"&gt;//groups.google.com/
&lt;/span&gt;group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/81ba15d7e9130441

For clojure.core$last__2954.invoke the correct bytecode would be (notice 
the removed &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"&lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;goto&lt;/span&gt;    65"&lt;/span&gt; after &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"41:  &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;goto&lt;/span&gt;    0"&lt;/span&gt;):

   62:  areturn

Our JIT reported incorrect stack size along the basic block introduced by 
the unneeded &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;goto&lt;/span&gt;.
The bug was present in SVN rev 1205.&lt;/pre&gt;

            <title>[CLJ-42] GC Issue 38: When using AOT compilation, "load"ed files are not reloaded on (require :reload 'name.space)</title>
                <link>http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-42</link>
                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;Reported by m...@kotka.de, Jan 07, 2009
What (small set of) steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Create a file src/foo.clj

cat &amp;gt;src/foo.clj &amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOF
(ns foo (:load &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"bar"&lt;/span&gt;))
EOF

2. Create a file src/bar.clj

cat &amp;gt;src/bar.clj &amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOF
(clojure.core/in-ns 'foo)
(def x 8)
EOF

3. Start Clojure Repl: java -cp src:classes clojure.main -r

4. Compile the namespace.

user=&amp;gt; (compile 'foo)
foo

5. Require the namespace
user=&amp;gt; (require :reload-all :verbose 'foo)
(clojure.core/load &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"/foo"&lt;/span&gt;)
(clojure.core/load &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"/bar"&lt;/span&gt;)

What is the expected output? What &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; you see instead?

6. Re-Require the namespace

user=&amp;gt; (require :reload-all :verbose 'foo)
(clojure.core/load &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"/foo"&lt;/span&gt;)

Only the &lt;span class="code-quote"&gt;"master"&lt;/span&gt; file is loaded, but not the bar file.
Expected would have been to also load the bar file.
Changes to bar.clj are not reflected, and depending
on the setting (eg. using multimethods in foo from
a different namespace) code may be corrupted.

What version are you using?

SVN rev. 1195&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Use available metadata to check calls when possible&lt;/pre&gt;

            <title>[CLJ-5] Unintuitive error response in clojure 1.0</title>

                <project id="10010" key="CLJ">Clojure</project>
                        <description>&lt;p&gt;The following broken code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(let [&lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;x y&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; {}] x)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;provides the following stack trace:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: nth not supported on this type: PersistentArrayMap (test.clj:0)&lt;br/&gt;

        ... 10 more&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The message "nth not supported on this type" while correct doesn't make the cause of the error very clear.  Better error messages when destructuring would be very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <comment id="27279" author="ekoontz" created="Fri, 11 Nov 2011 17:36:54 -0800">&lt;p&gt;Please see the attached patch which produces a (hopefully more clear) error message as shown below (given the broken code shown in the original bug report):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;Clojure 1.4.0-master-SNAPSHOT
user=&amp;gt; (let [x 42 y 43] (+ x y))
85
user=&amp;gt; (let [[x y] {}] x)
UnsupportedOperationException left side of binding must be a symbol (found a PersistentVector instead).  clojure.lang.&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;Compiler&lt;/span&gt;.checkLet (&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;Compiler&lt;/span&gt;.java:6545)
user=&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, this patch checks the argument of (let) as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;user=&amp;gt; (let 42)
UnsupportedOperationException argument to (let)  must be a vector (found a &lt;span class="code-object"&gt;Long&lt;/span&gt; instead).  clojure.lang.&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;Compiler&lt;/span&gt;.checkLet (&lt;span class="code-object"&gt;Compiler&lt;/span&gt;.java:6553)&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="27280" author="ekoontz" created="Fri, 11 Nov 2011 17:38:24 -0800">&lt;p&gt;Patch produced by doing git diff against commit ba930d95fc (master branch).&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="27290" author="ekoontz" created="Sun, 13 Nov 2011 21:24:45 -0800">&lt;p&gt;Sorry, this patch is wrong: it assumes that the left side of the binding is wrong - the &lt;tt&gt;&lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;x y&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; in :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;(let [[x y] {}] x)&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;because &lt;tt&gt;&lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;x y&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is a vector, when in fact, the left side is fine (per &lt;a href="http://clojure.org/special_forms#let"&gt;http://clojure.org/special_forms#let&lt;/a&gt; : "Clojure supports abstract structural binding, often called destructuring, in let binding lists".)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it's the right side (the {}) that needs to be checked and flagged as erroneous, not the &lt;tt&gt;&lt;span class="error"&gt;&amp;#91;x y&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                    <comment id="27374" author="carinmeier" created="Wed, 30 Nov 2011 10:15:24 -0800">&lt;p&gt;Add patch better-error-for-let-vector-map-binding&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This produces the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;(let [[x y] {}] x)
Exception map binding to vector is not supported&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other cases that are not handled by this though &amp;#8212; like binding vector to a set&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;user=&amp;gt; (let [[x y] #{}] x)
UnsupportedOperationException nth not supported on &lt;span class="code-keyword"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; type: PersistentHashSet&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wondering if it might be better to try convert the map to a seq to support?  Although this might be another issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

Is this issue indicative of a larger problem that should be addressed? Even if this is the only case where bindings produce poor error messages, all the cases described above should be addressed in the patch.  &lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;Added support for nested destructuring errors&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="codeContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre class="code-java"&gt;let [[[x1 y1][x2 y2]] [[1 2] {}]]
;=&amp;gt; UnsupportedOperationException let cannot destructure class clojure.lang.PersistentArrayMap.&lt;/pre&gt;

                    <comment id="27496" author="tsdh" created="Fri, 23 Dec 2011 05:37:53 -0800">&lt;p&gt;I think the decision of having to specify either a Closeable resource or a close function for an existing non-Closeable resource in with-open is quite awkward, because they have completely different meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="preformattedContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;  (let [foo (open-my-custom-resource "foo.bar")]
    (with-open [r (reader "foo.txt")
                foo #(.terminate foo)]
      (do-stuff r foo)))
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think a CloseableResource protocol that can be extended to custom types as implemented in the patch to &lt;a href="#CLJ-308"&gt;CLJ-308&lt;/a&gt; is somewhat easier to use.  Extend it once, and then you can use open-my-custom-resource in with-open just like reader/writer and friends...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, Scopes can still be useful, but I'd vote for handling the "how should that resource be closed" question by a protocol.  Then the with-open helper can simply add&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"&gt;&lt;div class="preformattedContent panelContent"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;(swap! *scope* conj (fn [] (clojure.core.protocols/close ~(bindings 0))))
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;and cleanup-scope only needs to apply each fn without having to distinguish Closeables from fns.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
